# ttrpg-expert

## What It Does

Your rules expert, content creator, and campaign consultant rolled into one. ttrpg-expert knows the mechanics of Call of Cthulhu 7e, GURPS 4e, Forged in the Dark, D&D 5e (2024 Revision), and Pathfinder 2e (Remaster) and can generate game-ready content for any of them.

It operates in three modes: answering rules questions and validating mechanics, generating ready-to-use content (NPCs, locations, encounters, handouts), and checking your campaign for plot holes and continuity errors.

## When to Use It

Reach for ttrpg-expert when you need to:

- Look up or validate game mechanics
- Build a character or track a point budget
- Generate an NPC, location, faction, item, or creature
- Design an encounter or write a scenario
- Plan a session structure
- Write an in-game handout (letters, newspaper clippings, diary entries, telegrams)
- Check your campaign for plot holes or continuity errors
- Get a random table result or spark of inspiration

## What You Need

**Obsidian:** Optional. ttrpg-expert is fully functional without Obsidian. If you have a campaign vault set up, it can read your files for better continuity checking.

**Game system context:** Tell Claude which system you're working in. It won't assume.

## What to Expect

When you ask a rules question, Claude will cite the specific source (e.g., "Basic Set — Characters, p.14" for GURPS).

When generating content, Claude will ask clarifying questions first — game system, tone, constraints — then produce complete, template-based output with stat blocks, descriptions, and mechanical notes ready for the table.

For character builds, Claude tracks point budgets and validates choices against the system's rules as it goes.

For continuity checking, Claude looks for 11 categories of problems including timeline contradictions, knowledge violations, orphaned threads, and dead-end clues.

All generated content starts as DRAFT status. It becomes canon when you confirm it.

## Game System Data Sources

Each supported game system has its own subfolder under
`systems/` with core reference files: mechanics, character
generation, session procedures, and a character sheet
template. Most systems also have a rules reference file;
GURPS uses topic-based files for efficient lookup.

- **D&D 5e (2024)** — `systems/dnd-5e-2024/`. Content sourced
  from the SRD 5.2, licensed under CC-BY 4.0 by Wizards of
  the Coast. Built directly into the skill.

- **Pathfinder 2e (Remaster)** — `systems/pf2e/`. Content
  paraphrased from ORC-licensed Paizo sources (Player Core,
  Player Core 2, GM Core, Monster Core, Monster Core 2).
  Spells shard by rank, monsters by level band, feats by
  category. Built directly into the skill.

- **Forged in the Dark** — `systems/fitd/`. Content sourced
  from the Blades in the Dark SRD, licensed under CC-BY 3.0
  by John Harper / One Seven Design. Built directly into the
  skill.

- **Call of Cthulhu 7e** — `systems/coc-7e/`. Core mechanics
  sourced from the Basic Roleplaying SRD (ORC License,
  Chaosium). CoC-specific content (investigator skills,
  Sanity system) attributed to the official free character
  sheet. Built into the skill.

- **GURPS 4e** — `systems/gurps-4e/`. Uses topic-based
  reference files (traits, skills, equipment, spells, combat,
  magic, powers, social rules) instead of a single rules
  reference. All curated Basic Set content (point costs,
  tables, workflows) is distributed under the SJG Online
  Policy. Check `sources.md` for which books are currently
  integrated.

All systems support personal reference files for setting
content and supplements you own. See
[Adding Your Own Reference Material](personal-reference-files.md).

- **Other systems** — `systems/generic/`. Universal RPG
  guidance for any system not listed above. Covers common
  resolution mechanics, character creation patterns, and
  session running principles.

## Tips

- Always specify the game system upfront. Claude supports five systems and needs to know which one you're in.
- For GURPS characters, give a point budget and concept. Claude will track every point spent.
- If you have a campaign vault, mention it. Claude can cross-reference existing entities for consistency.
- Be specific about tone. "A friendly innkeeper" and "a friendly innkeeper hiding a dark secret" produce very different results.
- Ask for handouts in a specific format. Claude can write letters, newspaper articles, diary entries, telegrams, and other in-world documents.
