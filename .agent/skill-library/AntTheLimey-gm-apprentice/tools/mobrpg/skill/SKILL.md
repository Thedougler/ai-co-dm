name: mobrpg-sync
description: "Use when the GM wants to sync a gm-apprentice vault with a mobRPG world — seeing what's new in mobRPG, pushing vault entities and authored descriptions up as mobRPG suggestions, pulling ratified mobRPG canon and description prose back into the vault, migrating a legacy vault onto mobrpg: nodes, or maintaining the vault↔mobRPG type mapping. Drives the mobrpg CLI with judgment and a preview-before-submit report, and keeps every write behind an explicit confirm. Trigger on 'sync to mobrpg', 'what's new in mobrpg', 'push my vault to mobrpg', 'suggest my descriptions to mobrpg', 'pull canon from mobrpg', 'update my mobrpg mapping', 'link my vault to mobrpg', 'send these NPCs to mobrpg', 'mobrpg suggestions', or any request to move campaign content between the vault and mobRPG — even a vague 'get this into mobrpg'."

mobRPG is Tim Dennis's shareable world-builder; the vault is the GM's working
surface. This skill keeps the two in sync by driving the `mobrpg` CLI — it is the
judgment layer, not a second copy of the CLI. It never calls the API directly:
it runs verbs, reads their output, and decides what to show you and what to ask.

Install the CLI once — `python3 -m pip install -e tools/mobrpg` — which puts a
`mobrpg` command on PATH; every command below is a bare `mobrpg …`. (If PATH
isn't picking it up, `python3 -m mobrpg.cli …` is equivalent.) The agent-facing
CLI guide is `tools/mobrpg/llms.txt` — read it if a verb's behavior is unclear
rather than guessing flags.

## On invocation: orient, then route

First, orient (all read-only — nothing here writes):
1. Find the vault (ask if not given). Confirm the CLI runs: `mobrpg whoami`.
   If it reports no credentials, walk the GM through first-time setup —
   `references/auth-setup.md` (one-URL download preferred, manual CSV fallback).
2. Note the target: the client prints `mobRPG target: PROD/DEV` to stderr, plus a
   loud `⚠️ THIS IS PRODUCTION` banner when the env is prod (the default). If the
   target is PROD, treat every `--execute` as a live write against Tim's shared
   world — surface that before running one, and prefer `MOBRPG_ENV=dev`.
3. Take a discovery snapshot: `mobrpg whats-new <world> --vault <path>` reports, in
   one read-only pass, what's **new** in mobRPG (entities with no linked node),
   **gone** (vault nodes deleted upstream — zombie notes to reconcile), and **new
   classifier types** not yet mapped. It's the fastest way to see where the two
   sides have diverged before you pick a phase.

Then detect where the GM is and route. Honor an explicit ask ("push", "pull
canon", "fix my mapping") over the detected default.

| Read-only signal | Route to |
|---|---|
| entities lack a `mobrpg:` node entirely — the vault was never linked to this world | **Establish nodes** → push net-new via `references/push.md`; for entities that already exist upstream, match them to live elements by name and stamp nodes with `adopt`, then run `mobrpg sync` to seed each note's `last_synced`. (Legacy `*-crosswalk.json` sidecars are unsupported and untrusted — never read one; nodes are the only source of truth.) |
| no `<vault>/_meta/mobrpg-map.json`, or `mobrpg map check` / `whats-new` shows `new`/unmapped vocab or new classifier types (map drift) | **Mapping maintenance** → `references/mapping-maintenance.md` |
| map clean and `mobrpg suggest --write-back` (dry-run) shows net-new entities to push | **Push** → `references/push.md` |
| `mobrpg suggestions <world> --state Accepted\|Dismissed --correlate --vault <path>` (two queries — one per state) shows ratified suggestions awaiting pull-back, **or** `mobrpg sync <world> --vault <path>` (dry-run) shows notes whose description prose has drifted on either side, **or** `whats-new` reports `gone`/new entities to reconcile | **Reconcile** → `references/reconcile.md` |

Present what you found and the recommended phase; let the GM redirect.

## Safety — applies to every phase

These are short and needed every time, so they live here, not in a reference file.

- **Dry-run → present → confirm → execute.** Every mutating verb runs dry-run
  first. Show the result, get an explicit yes, only then re-run with `--execute`.
  Never chain straight to `--execute`.
- **A PROD `--execute` writes to the live shared world.** There is no extra
  env-var opt-in — `--execute` alone submits. If the target is PROD, say so
  before running one and let the GM decide, or switch to `MOBRPG_ENV=dev` for a
  non-prod run. Never run a PROD `--execute` on your own initiative.
- **State detection is read-only** (`map check`, `catalog`, `suggestions`, `pull`,
  and any `--write-back`/`--execute`-less run). Reading never needs confirmation.
- **Invariants from the foundation audit:** an accepted `element_id` is preserved
  across vault edits (fixed on this branch); run `pull-canon` after any re-`suggest`
  so relationship links heal and no duplicate suggestion window opens; treat the
  node `element_id` as the identity source of truth.
