"""The vault-only / canon split of a vault note body.

mobRPG canon descriptions map to a note's authored prose; some H2 sections are
pure vault bookkeeping — `## GM Notes` (secret), and the play-log sections
`## Appearances` / `## Source References` / `## Notes` that `write` scaffolds and
`session-wrapup` appends to. None of them are canon: pushing them spammed the
world owner's review queue with bookkeeping churn (#147) and pulling destroyed
them (#146). `split_vault_only` slices the body into the canon-facing main and
the verbatim vault tail so `sync` can push/pull the main while preserving the
tail untouched.

Stdlib only, pure string surgery — no frontmatter, no HTML.

    in the canon slice and gets PUSHED, and a pull has no tail left to preserve.

    degrades to the pre-fence behavior (headings detected, secrets still
