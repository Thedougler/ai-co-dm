"""mobrpg pull-canon — pull ratified mobRPG canon down into vault nodes.

mobRPG is canon; the vault is the working surface. This applies the authority
rule per entity review_state: accepted (fill ids), accepted-after-edit / drift
(canon overwrites `determined`), dismissed (record note, preserve vault),
deleted (flag), pending (leave the vault alone). Reads the review queue via the
same endpoint `suggestions` uses. NOT named `reconcile` — that names a different
gm-apprentice concept (canon_status promotion).
