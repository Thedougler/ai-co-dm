"""mobrpg map — generate and maintain the per-vault mapping (vault vocab -> mobRPG types).

Turns the per-vault map from hand-authored into discovered-and-maintained. See
COMPLETE-SUGGESTIONS-SPEC.md ("The map command family").

    mobrpg map init  <world> --vault <path> [--out FILE]   # discover + scan + propose
    mobrpg map sync  <world> --vault <path> [--map FILE]    # re-discover, merge non-destructively
    mobrpg map check <world> --vault <path> [--map FILE]    # read-only coverage report

Discovery (mobRPG side) reuses the classifier catalog endpoints; the vault scan
collects the distinct values of the mapping-relevant frontmatter. `map` emits a
DRAFT: exact/ci matches bind to the existing type's real id (status "bound"),
unmatched values propose a new type ("new"), and genuinely ambiguous location
routes are flagged "review" for the skill / a human to resolve. Sync preserves
resolved entries: any entry with "confirmed": true, and any entry already bound
to a real mobrpgId. A hand-edited entry that sets neither is NOT protected — mark
it "confirmed": true to keep it.

Read-only against mobRPG; writes only the local map file (never the vault content).

# predicate vocabularies are all derived from the ontology in _derived() above and

# PREDICATE_RELATION, REVERSED_PREDICATES). Design notes preserved there:
#   - PREDICATE_EVENTTYPE: only non-Generic entries; a per-world map can override
#     any entry via `relationshipTypes`. Change the ontology, not this module.
#   - RELATION_TYPES / PREDICATE_RELATION: mobRPG's SECOND relationship mechanism,
#     a direct WorldElementRelation (Attribute|Link|Parent|Child|Spouse). Parent/
#     Child/Spouse are GENEALOGY BETWEEN PEOPLE (backend auto-creates the
#     reciprocal); place containment is a Link (single row, no reciprocal). This
#     is a stable backend enum, so it lives in the ontology, derived here.
#   - REVERSED_PREDICATES: spatial predicates are authored subordinate-first
#     ("X part_of Y" = Y contains X) but mobRPG's Link convention is container-
#     first; `suggest` swaps source/target for the ASYMMETRIC Link predicates so a
#     push never lands a reversed edge (borders is symmetric, so it is excluded).

    A term whose linked notes disagree is left out, so the ordinary heuristics
    (and the near-duplicate review) decide rather than an arbitrary winner.
