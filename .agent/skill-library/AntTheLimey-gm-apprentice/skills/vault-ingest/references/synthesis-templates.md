# Synthesis Templates

Reference for Phase 5. Vault-ingest's adapter layer — transforms
confirmed play events and GM answers into formats that downstream
skills expect.

## Play Notes Equivalent

The primary output. Must be processable by `session-wrapup` as
if a session just ended. Uses the document chain standard:
`type: session-play-notes` per `shared/session-document-chain.md`.

### Frontmatter

```yaml
---
type: session-play-notes
session: "[[Session NN - Title]]"
chapter: "[[Chapter N - Title]]"
campaign: "Campaign Name"
canon_status: AUTHORITATIVE
created_by: vault-ingest
---
```

### Required Body Sections

```markdown
> [!info] Reconstruction Note
> Reconstructed from [list source documents with classifications]
> on [date]. Keeper interview filled [N] gaps. [N] items remain
> unresolved.

## Play Events

[Chronological account of confirmed play events, organized by
scene or time period. Each event cites its source.]

### [Scene or Event Title]

- **Source:** [play fragment in X / keeper interview / timeline]
- **What happened:** [factual account]
- **Entities involved:** [[NPC]], [[Location]], [[Item]]
- **PC actions:** [specific player decisions and outcomes]
- **Mechanical events:** [dice rolls, skill checks, if known]

## Entity Flags

[Entity extraction markers for session-wrapup to process]

- NEW-NPC: [[Name]] — [brief description, source]
- NEW-LOC: [[Name]] — [brief description, source]
- NEW-ITEM: [[Name]] — [brief description, source]
- UPDATE: [[Existing Entity]] — [what changed, source]

## Unresolved Items

- [ ] [Item 1 — what we don't know and why]
- [ ] [Item 2]

## Source Material Index

| Source | Classification | Canon Value |
|---|---|---|
| [filename] | [type] | [AUTHORITATIVE/DRAFT/NOT CANON] |
```

## Reconstruction Note Format

Always include at the top of synthesized Play Notes. This tells
session-wrapup (and future readers) that this is reconstructed
content, not live capture.

```markdown
> [!info] Reconstruction Note
> Reconstructed from:
> - old-session-notes.md (play fragments, scenario prep)
> - keeper interview (5 questions, 3 follow-ups)
> on 2026-04-22.
>
> Limitations: No play transcript exists. Events reconstructed
> from prep documents and keeper memory. 2 items remain
> unresolved (see Unresolved Items below).
```

## Synthesis Rules

1. **Only confirmed events.** Nothing from DRAFT or NOT CANON
   sources unless the keeper confirmed it in Phase 4.

2. **Cite everything.** Every play event must be traceable to
   a source: "play fragment in old-notes.md", "keeper interview
   Q3", "existing timeline entry".

3. **Preserve uncertainty.** If the keeper said "I think so,"
   include the event but mark with `<!-- UNVERIFIED -->`.

4. **Entity flags are for session-wrapup.** Use the extraction
   shorthand from `session-wrapup/references/recap-formats.md`
   (NEW-NPC, NEW-LOC, UPDATE, etc.) so wrapup knows what to
   create and update. When session-wrapup creates entities from
   these flags, it reads `_Templates/_Template_{Type}.md` first —
   see session-wrapup Step 4.

5. **Chronological order.** Events within a scene are ordered
   as they happened. Scenes are ordered as they played.

6. **Scene-by-scene when possible.** If the source material or
   keeper interview reveals a scene structure, use it. If not,
   organize by topic or entity cluster.

## Character Story Backstory Entries

In addition to Play Notes, Phase 5 produces a consolidated
story entry for each PC active during the ingested period.
These are written directly to the PC's story file, not to the
Play Notes output.

### Format

Frontmatter:

```yaml
---
type: character-story
character: "[[{Name}]]"
campaign: "Campaign Name"
canon_status: DRAFT
lastUpdated: "{last ingested session}"
asOfSession: "{last ingested session}"
createdSession: "{first ingested session}"
---
```

Body:

```markdown
## Sessions {first}–{last} — {Summary Title}

{Narrative prose covering this character's arc across the
ingested period. Length proportional to available detail —
no padding, no fabrication. If sources are sparse, write less
rather than inventing specifics.}

<!-- sparse source material -->
{Include this comment only when the entry is thin due to
limited source data, not a gap in the skill's work.}
```

### Synthesis Rules (Story Entries)

1. **Compile from all sources.** Draw on extracted play events,
   keeper interview answers (especially § PC Narrative Arcs),
   and any per-character source material.

2. **One consolidated entry per PC.** Headed
   `## Sessions {first}–{last} — {Summary Title}`. Not
   per-session entries — historical notes rarely have that
   granularity.

3. **Genre voice from campaign overview.** Same voice matching
   as session-wrapup uses. See
   `shared/character-story-format.md` for the genre-voice
   table.

4. **Scale prose to available data.** Rich sources get longer
   entries. Sparse sources get shorter entries with a
   `<!-- sparse source material -->` marker. Never fabricate
   detail to fill space. Authoring a backstory entry is a grudging
   exception — you write because no story prose exists yet, not to
   improve the GM's own words; where a source already holds
   finished prose, preserve it.
   (authoring exception to `shared/content-fidelity.md`)

5. **Create file from template if needed.** Use
   `shared/templates/character-story.md`. If a story file
   already exists (e.g., from a prior ingestion run or live
   sessions), append the new consolidated entry below existing
   content.

6. **Follow character-story-format.md.** Character names not
   player names, past tense for events, wiki-links for entity
   references, character's perspective.
