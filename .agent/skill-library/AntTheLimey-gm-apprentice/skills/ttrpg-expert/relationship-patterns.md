## Modeling Patterns

### Family Networks

```text
Grandfather ─┬─ Grandmother
             │
             ├─ Father ─┬─ Mother
             │          │
             │          ├─ Player Character
             │          └─ Sibling
             │
             └─ Uncle ─── Cousin
```

Relationships:
- Father → PC: `family` (parent)
- PC → Father: `family` (child)
- PC → Sibling: `family` (sibling), bidirectional
- PC → Cousin: `family` (cousin), bidirectional

### Faction Hierarchy

```text
Faction Leader
     │
     ├── Lieutenant 1
     │      ├── Member A
     │      └── Member B
     │
     └── Lieutenant 2
            └── Member C
```

Relationships:
- Leader → Faction: `leader`, strength 10
- Lieutenant → Leader: `reports_to`
- Member → Faction: `member`
- Member → Lieutenant: `reports_to`

### Love Triangle

```text
    Character A
      /     \
     /       \
Character B ─ Character C
```

Relationships:
- A → B: `romantic`, bidirectional
- A → C: `romantic`, bidirectional
- B → C: `rival`, bidirectional

## Best Practices

### When Creating Relationships

1. **Choose appropriate type**
   Use the most specific type that fits

2. **Set bidirectionality correctly**
   Consider if relationship is mutual

3. **Include context**
   Add description for non-obvious connections

4. **Consider tone**
   Emotional quality adds depth

5. **Update when things change**
   Relationships evolve in play

### When Querying Relationships

1. **Consider bidirectionality**
   Check both directions for bidirectional relationships

2. **Filter by type**
   Don't show all relationships at once

3. **Include entity details**
   Return enough context to understand

### Relationship Visualization

For network graphs:
- Node size: Entity importance
- Edge thickness: Relationship strength
- Edge color: Relationship tone
- Edge style: Bidirectional (solid) vs unidirectional (arrow)
