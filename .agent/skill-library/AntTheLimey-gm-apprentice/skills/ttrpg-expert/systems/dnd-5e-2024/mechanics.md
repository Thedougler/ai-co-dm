# D&D 5e 2024 -- Core Mechanics

## System Overview

d20-based heroic fantasy. Roll d20 + modifiers >= target number (DC or AC). Published by Wizards of the Coast; 2024 revision updates the 2014 rules with weapon mastery, streamlined crafting, revised feats, and a unified prepared-spell model. Characters defined by class, species, background, and level (1-20).

## Dice Conventions

| Die | Usage |
|-----|-------|
| d20 | Core resolution: ability checks, attack rolls, saving throws |
| d4/d6/d8/d10/d12 | Damage, healing, hit dice, variable effects |
| d100 | Random tables, Wild Magic Surge |

Roll d20 vs DC (checks/saves) or AC (attacks). Meet or exceed = success. Round down all fractions unless told otherwise.

## The Six Ability Scores

| Ability | Abbr | Measures | Checks | Saves |
|---------|------|----------|--------|-------|
| Strength | STR | Physical might | Lift, push, break | Resist direct force |
| Dexterity | DEX | Agility, reflexes | Move nimbly/quietly | Dodge harm |
| Constitution | CON | Health, stamina | Push body beyond limits | Endure toxins |
| Intelligence | INT | Reasoning, memory | Reason, remember | Recognize illusions |
| Wisdom | WIS | Perception, fortitude | Notice things | Resist mental assault |
| Charisma | CHA | Confidence, poise | Influence, entertain | Assert identity |

**Score range:** 1-30 for all creatures. PCs typically 8-15 at creation, cap at 20 without magic. 10-11 = human average.

## Advantage and Disadvantage

**Natural 20:** Always hits, Critical Hit -- roll weapon/spell damage dice twice, then add modifiers.
