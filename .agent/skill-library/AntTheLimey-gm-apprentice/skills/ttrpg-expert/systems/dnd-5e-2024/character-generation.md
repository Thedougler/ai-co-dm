# D&D 5e 2024 -- Character Generation

Step-by-step creation from the SRD 5.2 (2024 revision).

## Published Site Defaults

When creating a PC entity file, set `display_meta` to control
which fields appear in the character's header on a published
campaign site. Recommended for D&D 5e:

```yaml
display_meta: [class, level, race]
```

If `display_meta` is omitted, the publish tool falls back to
`[occupation, age, nationality]`.

## Creation Workflow

1. **Choose a Class** -- pick from 12 core classes
2. **Determine Origin** -- select background and species, choose languages
3. **Determine Ability Scores** -- generate six scores, assign, adjust
4. **Choose an Alignment** -- nine alignments (LG/NG/CG/LN/N/CN/LE/NE/CE)
5. **Fill in Details** -- class features, derived numbers, equipment, spells

## Step 1: Choose a Class

| Class | Likes | Primary Ability | Complexity |
|-------|-------|-----------------|------------|
| Barbarian | Battle | Strength | Average |
| Bard | Performing | Charisma | High |
| Cleric | Gods | Wisdom | Average |
| Druid | Nature | Wisdom | High |
| Fighter | Weapons | Strength or Dexterity | Low |
| Monk | Unarmed combat | Dexterity and Wisdom | High |
| Paladin | Defense | Strength and Charisma | Average |
| Ranger | Survival | Dexterity and Wisdom | Average |
| Rogue | Stealth | Dexterity | Low |
| Sorcerer | Power | Charisma | High |
| Warlock | Occult lore | Charisma | High |
| Wizard | Spellbooks | Intelligence | Average |

- Write level (typically 1) and XP (0 at level 1).
- At level 3+, choose a subclass.
- Note class's armor training.
