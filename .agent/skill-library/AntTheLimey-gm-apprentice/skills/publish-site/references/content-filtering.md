# Content Filtering Reference

## Content Visibility Model

All campaign content falls into three categories:

### Always excluded (default, no prompt needed)

- `_meta/`, `_Templates/`, `personal/` directories
- All prep files: sessions/scenes with `status: planned | prepped`,
  `stage: outline | draft | ready`
- Files with `source: "prep"` that have no played counterpart
- H2 sections listed in `exclude_sections` (default: `["GM Notes", "DM Notes", "Player Notes", "Source References", "Reconciliation Context", "Handoff to Reconcile"]`)
- Content between `<!-- gm-only -->` / `<!-- /gm-only -->` markers
- **Every other `<!-- ... -->` comment.** Private authoring notes
  (`<!-- UNVERIFIED: … -->`, change logs, import provenance) are
  stripped before render and never reach the site. Comments inside
  fenced code blocks are preserved. An unclosed `<!--` strips to end
  of file and prints a build warning.
- Frontmatter fields in `exclude_fields` (default:
  `["secrets", "current_plan", "plan_progress", "gm_notes", "prep_notes"]`)
- Files whose frontmatter says `publish: false` — in **every** mode,
  including `full`. The file still parses, so links to it render as
  plain text rather than as a broken link; no page is emitted.
- Fields named in a file's own `publish_exclude_fields`, on that file
  only, merged over the global `exclude_fields`.
- Relationship edges marked `gm_only: true` — removed from the page,
  its relationship graph, and the search index.
- On a `publish: stub` file, everything except the sections named in
  `publish_include_sections`.

### Frontmatter is not covered by the fence

`<!-- gm-only -->` is a **body** primitive. It has no meaning inside
frontmatter, and it never has had — so a secret that lives in a field
(`occupation`, `key_traits`) or in a relationship target is not
protected by fencing the body, and neither are the views derived from
those fields: the character sheet, the Connections graph, the search
index. That is what `publish_exclude_fields` and edge-level `gm_only`
are for. Reach for them whenever the *fact of the field* is the secret
— a traitor whose `occupation` names their true allegiance, or an edge
to the cult leader whose existence gives the game away.

### Always included

- Played/reviewed sessions (`status: played | reviewed`)
- Scenes with `status: played` or `status: modified` (they
  happened — publish the reality, even if modified from plan)
- Entity files in standard vault folders
- `_Campaign/` overview files
- `_attachments/` images referenced by included entities

### Always excluded (scene-level)

- Scenes with `status: cut` (removed from the session)
- Scenes with `status: skipped` (didn't happen)

### Ambiguous (ask the GM)

- Files with no `type` field
- Files in non-standard directories
- Entities with `canon_status: SUPERSEDED` that have
  no `superseded_by` reference

## Configuration

All settings live in `_meta/vault-config.md` under `publish:`.
See the design spec for the full schema.

## Inline GM-Only Markers

For cases where GM and player content are mixed within a
single section, use inline markers:

~~~markdown
The tavern is warm and inviting.

<!-- gm-only -->
The barkeep is secretly a spy for the Crimson Court.
<!-- /gm-only -->

A notice board hangs near the door.
~~~

**Rules:**
- Markers must be on their own lines
- Can appear anywhere in body text (not in frontmatter)
- Can span multiple paragraphs
- The processor strips markers and everything between them

**Primary approach:** Put GM content under a "GM Notes" H2
heading. Use inline markers only when you need finer control
within a section.

**Edge cases:**
- Unclosed marker: content stripped to end of file (safe default)
- Marker inside a code block: ignored (treated as literal)

## Inline Spoiler Markers

For narrative content that's hidden only because the story hasn't
reached it yet — not permanently secret — use `<!-- spoiler -->` /
`<!-- /spoiler -->` instead of `<!-- gm-only -->`. Mechanically
identical (same open/close-pair rules: own lines, body text only, can
span paragraphs, code-fence-literal), but semantically and
operationally different:

~~~markdown
The innkeeper seems friendly enough.

<!-- spoiler -->
He's secretly reporting the party's movements to the cult.
<!-- /spoiler -->
~~~

**`<!-- gm-only -->` never converts** — it's meta content (tactics,
design notes) that's never meant to be player-facing, regardless of
story progress.

**`<!-- spoiler -->` is lifecycle-managed.** There's no pre-declared
reveal date — a GM doesn't know which session will reveal a given
secret until play gets there. Instead, `reconcile` (run every session)
checks entities the session actually touched for open `<!-- spoiler -->`
blocks and asks the GM whether each was revealed in play. On yes, the
fence markers are stripped — a plain text edit, so the content is
permanently public prose from then on with no new state to track. See
`shared/reconcile.md` for the exact step.

Because a spoiler can be revealed in an entity that reconcile didn't
happen to check that session (the reveal happened in dialogue that
never made it into the wrap-up notes, or the entity wasn't obviously
"touched"), campaign-qa also runs a full-vault open-spoilers audit on
demand — see `campaign-qa/references/check-procedures.md`.

## Excluding Callouts (opt-in)

Obsidian callouts (`> [!type] Title` blocks) are **published by
default** — `exclude_callouts` defaults to `false`, so an existing
vault with no explicit setting still renders every callout to the
site. Enable stripping with `publish.exclude_callouts` (or
`excludeCallouts` in `vault.config.json`):

- `true` — strip every callout
- an array of types, e.g. `["warning", "danger", "info"]` — strip
  only callouts of those types

The gm-apprentice convention treats callouts as Keeper-facing
(Campaign Design Decisions, Alert Levels, Keeper-Only notes, Canon
State), so **newly scaffolded** sites set `excludeCallouts: true` by
default. Sites created before this option existed keep the default
`false` until you set it explicitly — if you rely on callouts to hide
Keeper content, turn it on, or move that content under a `## GM Notes`
heading or `<!-- gm-only -->` markers, which are excluded regardless.

Plain blockquotes (`> "an in-world quote"`) carry no `[!type]` marker
and are never touched — keep read-aloud text as a plain blockquote,
not a callout, if you want it published. Callout examples inside a
fenced code block are preserved as documentation.

## Publish Manifest

The manifest at `_meta/publish-manifest.md` is the work order
for the build tool. It lists every file categorized as
publish/exclude/needs-decision.

The build tool reads this file directly — no rescanning needed.

### Manifest Format

The manifest is a markdown file with YAML frontmatter and three
H2 sections. The build tool's parser (`lib/manifest.js`) uses the
heading to bucket each entry into Publishing/Excluded/Needs
Decision. Only `mode: player` (see § Publish Modes) enforces the
manifest as an inclusion filter — and even there, a file publishes
if and only if it's a **checked** entry under `## Publishing`.
Checking the box under `## Excluded` or `## Needs Decision` never
publishes the file: those buckets are read (Excluded, to suppress a
separate "missing from manifest" warning) but never for inclusion.
In `mode: full` (the GM's own copy), the manifest isn't applied as
a filter at all — every scanned page publishes regardless of what's
checked.

**Frontmatter** (metadata, not used by the build tool):

~~~yaml
---
generated: 2026-04-22T10:00:00Z
vault: "My Campaign"
mode: player
total_files: 25
publishing: 18
excluded: 5
needs_decision: 2
---
~~~

**Sections:**

- `## Publishing` — files to include in the build. Each entry
  is a checked checkbox with a vault-relative path:
  `- [x] Characters/NPCs/Friendly Merchant.md`
  Optionally annotated with an inline reason, like Excluded:
  `- [x] Documents/House Rules.md — the party's own notes`

- `## Excluded` — files to exclude. Also uses checked checkboxes.
  Optionally annotated with a reason:
  `- [x] Sessions/Session 7.md — prep`

- `## Needs Decision` — files the GM hasn't categorized yet.
  Uses **unchecked** checkboxes: `- [ ] Events/Ambiguous Event.md`
  The build tool ignores these (they are not published).
  When the GM decides, check the box and move the line to
  Publishing or Excluded.

**Path format:** All paths are vault-relative using forward
slashes (e.g. `Characters/NPCs/Alice.md`). Never use absolute
filesystem paths. An inline `— comment` after the path is ignored;
an em dash inside the filename itself is preserved. A Publishing
entry that matches no vault file prints a build warning rather
than silently dropping the page.

**Example manifest:**

~~~markdown
---
generated: 2026-04-22T10:00:00Z
vault: "Canticle of the End"
mode: player
total_files: 42
publishing: 30
excluded: 10
needs_decision: 2
---

~~~

## Campaign Image

The campaign image appears on the landing page hero and 404 page.
Set in `publish.theme.campaign_image` in `vault-config.md`.

**Path handling:** The value is a vault-relative path (e.g.
`_attachments/campaign-image.svg`). The build tool copies it to
the output `images/` directory and resolves the path automatically.
External URLs (`https://...`) are passed through unchanged.

**Supported formats:** JPG, PNG, WebP, GIF, SVG. SVG is ideal
for procedurally generated campaign art since it scales cleanly
and keeps file size small.

**Setup flow (sequential questioning):**

1. Ask: "Do you have an existing campaign image you'd like to use?"
2. If yes → ask for the path, validate it exists
3. If no → offer to generate a procedural SVG with genre-appropriate
   motifs using the campaign's theme palette
4. Store the vault-relative path in `campaign_image`

The generated SVG should use the theme's primary, accent, and
background colours and include decorative elements appropriate
to the genre (e.g. tactical HUD for military, arcane sigils
for fantasy, tentacles for horror).

## Themed 404 Page

Links to excluded entities resolve to a custom 404 page
with an in-world message. The message is stored at
`publish.four_oh_four.message` in `vault-config.md`.

The campaign image is also displayed on the 404 page when
configured. The 404 template uses absolute paths derived from
`siteUrl` so it works correctly when served from any nested URL.

**Setup flow:** Suggest 2-3 genre-appropriate messages as
options (e.g. "CLASSIFIED — CLEARANCE LEVEL INSUFFICIENT" for
military, "The stars are not yet right..." for horror). Accept
custom input as an alternative.

## Publish Modes

- `player` (default): Only player-known content is published
- `full`: Everything is published (GM's private reference copy)

## Setup Questioning Flow

First-time theme, image, and 404 setup is handled by the setup
wizard (see `setup-wizard.md` steps 8-10). The filtering workflow
in this document assumes those are already configured.

When content filtering is triggered outside of first-time setup
(capability 6 in SKILL.md), check `vault-config.md` for existing
theme/image/404 settings. If missing, ask the questions described
in the wizard steps before proceeding with the manifest workflow.
