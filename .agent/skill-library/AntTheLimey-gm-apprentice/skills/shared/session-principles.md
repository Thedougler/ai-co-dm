# Session Principles

Shared rules for session-prep, session-play, session-wrapup.
Read on first invocation.

## Core Idea

Campaign content cycles between **potential** (GM's prep —
branching scenes, multiple futures) and **reality** (what
happened at the table). Wrap-up captures reality as canon.
Prep builds new potential on established reality.

## Absolute Rules

- **Never estimate scene durations.** No "45-60 minutes."
  Durations constrain the GM and kill creative play.

- **Read the PC roster first.** Before anything else, read
  `player_characters.md`. Know every PC, their player, and
  status (active/retired/dead/NPC). Getting status wrong
  is a serious error.

- **Characters are the story.** Foreground PC arcs. Campaign
  plot serves the characters, not the reverse. (Lazy DM
  Step 1, Sly Flourish.)

- **Wiki-link everything.** Every entity reference:
  `[[wiki-link]]`. NPCs, locations, items, factions,
  sessions, scenes — all linked. **Inside a markdown table
  cell, use alias-form links only** (`[[Hassan]]`) — never an
  aliased link (`[[Target|Alias]]`) or an escaped pipe (`\|`),
  because both break the table when Obsidian reflows it. Full
  rule: `docs/file-format-standards.md` §4.

- **Reality over plans.** Once played, the plan is dead.
  Unplayed prep is scrap — only mention if it contains
  critical clues players still need.

- **The Plan is an instrument, not an audit trail.** Never
  lace the session-running content the Keeper reads (scenes,
  NPC references, world state) with the Plan's own edit history
  or defences against charges nobody made ("formally dropped",
  "this plan revises", "noted here only so it is a deliberate
  silence", "that is now wrong"). If another file is wrong, fix
  that file — do not carry a standing note that it is wrong. The
  `## Prior Prep Review` section is prep-time triage, not
  session content: keep it a terse "kept vs updated" note, not a
  changelog. Durable provenance belongs in a QA log, never
  woven through the content run at the table.

## Companion Skills

- **ttrpg-expert** — Content generation, rules reference,
  GM frameworks. Hand off when gaps need content. Key files:
  `arc-spotlight-reference.md` (arcs, spotlight, touchpoints),
  `npc-generation.md`, `continuity-engine.md` (Chekhov
  Protocol, Canon Grounding).

- **campaign-organizer** — Vault structure, entity filing.
  Hand off when work produces new entities. Dissect mode
  extracts entities from large documents.

- **campaign-qa** — Validation. Suggest QA after wrap-up
  or reconciliation. Thread/foreshadowing tracking:
  ttrpg-expert's `continuity-engine.md`.

## Vault Integration

Reads and writes to the campaign vault (Obsidian or plain
folder). All persistent state lives in the vault.

**First invocation:** Read `shared/vault-access.md` for
vault access — filesystem tools plus the bundled search and
graph utilities. Confirm the campaign folder path.

**Key vault locations:**
- `_meta/index.md` — Master registry. Read first.
- `Chapters/Chapter N/Sessions/` — Session notes.
- `Chapters/Chapter N/Scenes/` — Scene notes.
- `_Campaign/Timeline.md` — Campaign timeline.
- `_Campaign/Player Characters.md` — PC roster.

**Shared references:**
- `shared/vault-structure.md` — Folder layout, naming.
- `shared/entity-schema.md` — Entity types, frontmatter,
  temporal fields, relationships.
- `shared/canon-status.md` — DRAFT/AUTHORITATIVE/
  SUPERSEDED states and promotion rules.
- `shared/session-document-chain.md` — Document chain
  standard: Plan, Play Notes, Wrap-Up as separate files.
- `shared/reconcile.md` — Shared review procedure for
  promoting Wrap-Up canon status.

**Session document chain:** Read `shared/session-document-chain.md`
for the full standard. Sessions use separate files for Plan,
Play Notes, and Wrap-Up, linked by a session index hub.

**Session index frontmatter:**

```yaml
---
type: session
session_number: N
chapter: "[[Chapter N - Title]]"
status: planned | prepped | played | wrap-up | reviewed
documents:
  plan: "[[Session NN - Title - Plan]]"
  play_notes: "[[Session NN - Title - Play Notes]]"
  wrap_up: "[[Chapter_CC_Session_NN_Wrap_Up]]"
---
```

Status reflects the furthest document that exists. The `wrap-up`
status is new — it means a Wrap-Up file exists but the GM has
not yet reviewed it via reconcile.

No "half-played" status. If the session ended early, status
is **played** and unplayed content carries forward.

**Scene status:** `planned | ready | played | skipped | modified | cut`

## Working with Play Notes

Accept all forms: raw shorthand, expanded notes, transcripts,
combinations. Don't correct grammar in stored notes. Extract
entities, events, decisions. Ask for clarification only when
genuinely ambiguous. Cross-reference against prep notes.

## Session Note Naming

Convention from `_meta/vault-config.md`.
Default: `Session {NN} - {Title}.md` (zero-padded, evocative).
Good: `Session 07 - The Opera and the Invitation.md`
Bad: `Session 7 - March 15 2025.md`

## Canon Workflow

Entity creation is automatic during wrap-up. Don't ask — do it.

```text
Play: entity mentioned → noted in play notes
Wrap-up: entity found → campaign-organizer
  → vault file (canon_status: DRAFT)
  → wiki-linked into session note and related entities
```

GM promotes DRAFT → AUTHORITATIVE at their own pace.
See `shared/canon-status.md`.

## Reconcile Fast Path

The reconcile procedure (`shared/reconcile.md`) has a quick-scan
preamble. When a session has no UNVERIFIED markers, no DRAFT
conflicts, and no unplayed prep, the GM can approve bulk
promotion in one step instead of walking through all 6 steps.

Session-wrapup and session-prep should be aware of this — when
handing off to reconcile, note whether the session is likely to
qualify for the fast path based on what the skill already knows
about the session's complexity.
