# Reconcile

Shared procedure for reviewing vault content with the GM and
promoting canon status. Any skill can invoke this.

## When to Call

- **session-wrapup** — after producing a Wrap-Up file, walk
  GM through review before closing out
- **session-prep** — fallback when previous session is at
  `wrap-up` status (not yet `reviewed`)
- **vault-ingest** — after each ingested Wrap-Up is generated
- **standalone** — GM surfaces a contradiction or wants to
  review specific content ("these notes contradict Session 3")

Skip for first sessions or when status is already `reviewed`.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, have:
- The target Wrap-Up file path
- Access to related entity files and timeline entries
- The session index file for status updates

## Quick Scan — Fast Path

Before starting the full procedure, check three conditions:

1. **No unverified markers:** Zero `<!-- UNVERIFIED -->` markers
   in the Wrap-Up file
2. **No DRAFT conflicts:** Zero DRAFT entities that contradict
   existing AUTHORITATIVE entities on the same facts
3. **No unplayed prep:** No Plan file exists for this session
   (nothing to triage)

If all three pass, offer the fast path:

> "Straightforward session — no conflicts found, no unplayed
> prep. Promote all new entities to AUTHORITATIVE? (y/n)"

On GM confirmation:
- Set Wrap-Up `canon_status` to `AUTHORITATIVE` and stamp
  `reconciled:` with today's date (`"YYYY-MM-DD"`)
- Promote all DRAFT entities from this session to AUTHORITATIVE
- Update session index `status` to `reviewed`
- Skip to step 6.5 (world evolution offer)

If any condition fails → proceed with the full 6-step procedure
below.

## Procedure

### 1. Load the target

Read the Wrap-Up file. Read related entity files, timeline
entries, and any linked scene notes. Build a picture of what
this session established. *(reads only — no writes yet)*

### 2. Highlight uncertain areas

Surface everything that needs GM attention:
- `<!-- UNVERIFIED -->` markers in the Wrap-Up
- Reconstruction notes (`> [!info] Reconstruction Note`)
- DRAFT entities created during wrap-up
- Timeline entries with uncertain dates or ordering
- Any `canon_status: DRAFT` content tied to this session

Present as a short inventory, not a wall of text.

### 2.5. World fact review

If the Wrap-Up file's `## GM Notes` section contains a
`### World Fact Findings` subsection (staged by session-wrapup),
review each finding with the GM.

For each finding, present the three-state prompt:

- **Canon** → create or update the relevant `_World/` domain
  file and entities. Example: new heritage confirmed → create
  `Heritages/{Name}.md` from `shared/templates/heritage.md`,
  add entry to `_World/heritages.md`, record in `_flags.md`
  canon section.
  If `_World/` doesn't exist, create it first (world-index.md
  + _flags.md stubs from shared/templates/).
- **Ignore** → add to `_flags.md` ignored section with date
  and context. Future flags on this topic are suppressed.
- **Defer** → add to `_flags.md` deferred section with session
  number and context. If the item was being re-surfaced
  (accumulated mentions), present the accumulated context:
  "The Old Empire has come up in 3 sessions now — should we
  flesh this out?"

One finding at a time. Wait for GM decision before continuing.
Record each resolution in the `### Reconciliation Context`
subsection under `## GM Notes` (step 7).

### 3. Walk through conflicts

One conflict at a time. For each:
1. Show both versions (what the Wrap-Up says vs what the
   vault says, or two contradicting sources)
2. Explain the discrepancy in one sentence
3. Propose a resolution
4. **Wait for GM decision before moving on**

Each answer shapes the next question. This is a conversation,
not a report.

### 3.5. Spoiler reveal check

For every entity this session's Wrap-Up actually touched (created or
updated — the same bounded set session-wrapup already produced in its
receipt), check for open `<!-- spoiler -->` blocks. For each one
found, ask:

> "[[{Entity}]] has a pending spoiler: '{first ~10 words of the
> spoiler text}...' — was this revealed to the players this session?
> (y/n)"

On yes: remove the `<!-- spoiler -->` / `<!-- /spoiler -->` markers
from that entity's file, leaving the content as plain published
prose. On no: leave it untouched — it stays hidden and gets asked
about again next time this entity is touched, or caught by
campaign-qa's full-vault audit if it never comes up again (see
`publish-site/references/content-filtering.md`).

Skip this step entirely if none of this session's touched entities
contain a `<!-- spoiler -->` block — no empty prompt.

### 5. Salvageable prep triage

If a Plan file exists for this session, scan unplayed content.
For each unplayed element, ask the GM:

| Disposition | Meaning |
|-------------|---------|
| **drop** | No longer relevant, discard |
| **recycle** | Reuse in a future session |
| **must-still-happen** | Critical clue or event players still need |

Flag `must-still-happen` items prominently — these carry
forward into the next session's prep.

### 6. Promote canon status

On GM approval:
1. Set Wrap-Up `canon_status` to `AUTHORITATIVE` and stamp
   `reconciled:` with today's date (`"YYYY-MM-DD"`)
2. Update session index `status` to `reviewed`
3. Promote related entity `canon_status` from DRAFT
   to AUTHORITATIVE where GM confirmed content
   3b. Before finalizing each entity promotion, check the entity
       against active `_World/` rules (if `_World/` exists).
       If a world rule is violated:
       - Surface: "This NPC is 400 years old, but world rules
         say humans live 60-85 years. Is that intentional?"
       - **Yes, intentional** → promote with a note explaining
         the exception
       - **Correct it** → update the entity before promotion
       - **Defer** → promote but tag `needs_review: true`
4. Mark any contradicted content as `SUPERSEDED` with
   `superseded_by` reference

Do the bookkeeping immediately — don't leave a list for
the GM. Hand off to campaign-organizer if entity filing
is needed.

### 6.5. World evolution (conditional)

**Gate:** Only offer when reconciling the **most recent**
session. Check the session index for a `world_evolved` field
— if present and matching this session, skip.

> "Session is settled. Want to evolve the world — faction
> turns, consequence surfacing, foreshadowing review? This
> updates how the world responds to what just happened. (y/n)"

If the GM declines → skip to step 7.

If the GM accepts → read and follow
`ttrpg-expert/world-evolution.md`, skipping the Storage
Checkpoint (already established). Run the 6-step procedure:
thread state updates, faction turns, consequence surfacing,
foreshadowing review, discovery state updates, world state
changes. One item at a time, GM approves each — same
conversational style as the rest of reconcile.

**On completion:**
- Set `world_evolved: "Session_NN"` on the session index
  (current session reference)
- Entity files created or updated use
  `source: "world-evolution"`, with `lastUpdated` and
  `asOfSession` set to the current session
- Results feed into step 7's `### Reconciliation Context`
  under `#### World Evolution`, containing:
  - Faction turn summaries (one line per faction: action,
    impact level, what's visible to PCs)
  - Surfaced consequences (trigger, manifestation)
  - Foreshadowing changes (ripeness updates, new plants)
  - Discovery state changes (per-PC knowledge shifts)
  - World state changes (calendar, environment, politics)

### 7. Record decisions

Write a `### Reconciliation Context` subsection, opening
with a `**Reconciled:** YYYY-MM-DD` line (the same date
stamped into the frontmatter `reconciled:` field), capturing:
- **Consequences** — forward-looking summary of what this
  session established (every claim traceable to vault or
  play notes, no invention)
- **Promotion** — every entity moved DRAFT → AUTHORITATIVE,
  by name
- **Salvageable prep** — disposition of each unplayed item
- **GM decisions** — each conflict resolution with rationale
- **World evolution** — if step 6.5 ran, include a
  `#### World Evolution` sub-section with faction turn
  summaries, surfaced consequences, foreshadowing and
  discovery state changes, and world state updates

This section provides cross-conversation continuity.
Session-prep reads it to avoid re-gathering context.

**Where to write it:** Always in the Wrap-Up file, as a `###`
subsection **under that file's `## GM Notes` heading** —
if the file has none, create `## GM Notes` wrapped in its own
`<!-- gm-only -->`/`<!-- /gm-only -->` fence (reconcile has no
migration prerequisite, and an unfenced section on a legacy
file can reach a published player site). If the GM Notes
block is wrapped in a `<!-- gm-only -->` fence (standard since
1.9.5), insert the subsection **before** the `<!-- /gm-only -->`
closer — appending after it leaves the section outside the
fence, breaking the one-fence invariant. If a Plan file
exists, you may append a short pointer (`See Wrap-Up for
reconciliation context`) but the Wrap-Up file is the canonical
location.

**Why nested, not a top-level `## Reconciliation Context`:**
every item in it is Keeper-facing — GM decisions and their
rationale, unplayed prep, what the factions did while the PCs
weren't looking. As a sibling H2 it published to player sites,
because a GM's own `exclude_sections` list is respected as
written and a newly-added default never reaches a vault that
set its own. The 1.8.3 standard exists precisely so new GM
content needs no new exclude entry: put it under `## GM Notes`
and every config already hides it. Do not "fix" this by adding
`Reconciliation Context` to an exclude list.

**Reading it back:** accept either form — `###` under
`## GM Notes` (current) or a top-level `## Reconciliation
Context` (vaults not yet migrated).

## Rules

- **One conflict at a time.** Conversation, not report.
- **Never silently resolve.** Even obvious corrections need
  GM confirmation before writing.
- **Record as you go.** Write each resolution immediately
  after GM confirms. Don't batch.
- **Know when to stop.** If the GM says "good enough," stop.
  Partial review is better than no review.
