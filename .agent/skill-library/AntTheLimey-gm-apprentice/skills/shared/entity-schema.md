# Entity Schema

Merged reference combining entity type hierarchy, frontmatter
schemas, and per-type attribute tables for all campaign entities.

## System-Specific Guidance

Schemas here are system-agnostic. For system-specific stat
blocks, skill formats, and mechanical conventions, also read:
- CoC 7e: `systems/coc-7e/occupations.md` (percentile stats)
- D&D 5e: `systems/dnd-5e-2024/conditions-rules.md` (CR, proficiency)
- GURPS 4e: `systems/gurps-4e/character-generation.md` (point-buy attributes)
- FitD: `systems/fitd/factions.md` (tier, hold, clocks)

## Universal Fields

Apply to **every** entity type. Enable temporal queries
("what changed in session 5?", "which entities are stale?").

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| lastUpdated | string | Session number or date of last modification |
| asOfSession | string | Session when current state was confirmed accurate |
| createdSession | string | Session when first introduced |
| source | string | How it entered canon: "play", "prep", "backstory", or "world-evolution" |
| canon_status | string | Canon status: DRAFT / AUTHORITATIVE / SUPERSEDED / STUB |
| era | string | Optional: named era from `_World/history-timeline.md` (e.g., "Second Age"). Assumed campaign present if absent. |

Always set `lastUpdated` and `asOfSession` to current session
when filing or updating.

## Frontmatter Schemas

### Required Fields (All Entity Types)

```yaml
---
type: npc              # From the type hierarchy
canon_status: DRAFT    # DRAFT | AUTHORITATIVE | SUPERSEDED | STUB
aliases: []
tags: []
source_document: ""
campaign: ""
first_appearance: ""   # Link to scene or session
---
```

### Relationships Block

```yaml
relationships:
  - target: "[[Target Entity Name]]"
    type: member_of       # From _meta/relationship-types.md
    tone: respectful      # friendly | romantic | respectful
                          # professional | hostile | fearful
                          # distrustful | contemptuous | neutral
                          # unknown | complicated
    strength: 7           # 1-10 (1-2 weak, 9-10 defining)
    bidirectional: false
    description: "Serves as lieutenant"
    gm_only: false        # optional; true hides this edge from a published
                          # site — the page, its relationship graph, and the
                          # search index
```

Extraction defaults:

- `tone: neutral` and `strength: 5` when source is ambiguous
- `bidirectional: false` unless inherently symmetric
- Include `description` traceable to source text
- `gm_only` omitted (visible) unless the edge's *existence* is the secret

### Publish control fields

Optional, on any entity. Frontmatter carries no body prose, so
`<!-- gm-only -->` has no meaning there — these are how a secret in
frontmatter or a whole GM-facing file is kept off a player site.

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|-------|------|---------|
| `publish` | `false` \| `stub` | `false` — no page is emitted in any mode; the file still parses, so links to it render as plain text rather than as a broken link. `stub` — the page is emitted for navigation but only the sections named in `publish_include_sections` are kept. |
| `publish_exclude_fields` | array | Field names hidden on **this file only**, merged over the vault's global `exclude_fields`. Use when excluding a field campaign-wide would strip it from every honest entity too. |
| `publish_include_sections` | array | Only meaningful with `publish: stub`. Section headings to keep. Defaults to none — a stub opts content *in*. |

Absent means "publish normally"; a vault that uses none of these is
unaffected. An unrecognized `publish:` value is treated as normal
publication — a typo must not silently unpublish a page, nor silently
publish one. A `publish_exclude_fields` entry is **not** re-admitted by a
config-level `overrides.fields.*.include`: the file's own instruction about
its own secret outranks a campaign-wide default.

## Type-Specific Fields

NOTE: The Core Entity Types section above contains the detailed
attribute tables. This section is the compact summary used
during Dissect mode.

**NPC:** `occupation`, `age`, `gender`, `nationality`, `status`
(alive/dead/missing/unknown), `portrait` (optional)

**PC:** `player_name`, `occupation`, `age`, `gender`, `nationality`,

### PC Body Structure

The PC body-heading hierarchy, the `## Current Status` block spec,
and the Story Companion Convention now live in
`shared/pc-body-structure.md`.

**Character Story:** `character` (wiki-link to the PC), plus
universal fields — no other type-specific attributes. Body is
append-only session sections; see the Story Companion Convention in
`shared/pc-body-structure.md`.

**Location:** `location_type`, `parent_location` (wiki-link),
`atmosphere`, `portrait` (optional). `parent_location` groups the
published Locations listing (fallback: `location_type`).

etc.), `goals`, `leadership` (wiki-link), `territory` (wiki-link),
`part_of` (wiki-link to the parent body, optional), `portrait`
(optional). `faction_type` groups the published Factions listing.

**Item:** `item_type` (weapon, armor, relic, etc.),
`current_holder` (wiki-link), `origin`, `portrait` (optional)

**Event:** `event_type` (battle, ritual, etc.), `in_game_date` (in-game),
`location` (wiki-link), `participants` (wiki-links), `outcome`

**Plan:** `plan_type` (arc/scene/investigation/timeline),
`chapter` (wiki-link), `participants` (wiki-links),
`locations` (wiki-links), `leads_to` (wiki-links)

**Adventure Brief:** `scope` (campaign/one-shot/few-shot),
`sessions_estimated`, `continuation_type` (new/new-chapter/new-arc/time-jump/prequel/parallel/new-pcs),
`adventure_shape` (linear/branching/hub-and-spoke/open-node/sandbox),
`system`

**Campaign Overview:** `campaign`, `game_system`, `setting_year`,
`current_game_date`, `genre_tags`, `scope`, `status`, `sessions_played`,
`last_session`, `last_play_date`, `current_arc`, `arcs_planned`,
`current_chapter`, `chapters_planned`, `portrait` (optional)

**Creature:** `creature_type` (beast, undead, aberration, etc.),
`location` (wiki-link), `abilities`, `weaknesses`, `portrait` (optional)

**World Flags:** `last_reviewed`

### The `mobrpg:` node (machine-managed — do not hand-edit)

Entities synced to a mobRPG world carry a `mobrpg:` frontmatter node written and
maintained by the `mobrpg` CLI. It is a regenerable sync ledger, not authored
content — top-line frontmatter remains the single source of truth. Scalar values
are JSON-encoded (`key: "text"`, `key: null`).

| Key | Meaning |
|-----|---------|
| `world_id` / `external_ref` / `element_id` / `element_kind` | identity anchors (element_id is null until mobRPG accepts) |
| `review_state` | `pending` / `accepted` / `dismissed` / `edited` / `deleted` |
| `content_hash` / `last_synced` / `review_note` | sync bookkeeping |
| `determined` | classifiers derived and sent (mobRPG canon overwrites on edit) |
| `relationships[]` | reified-Event ids keyed by `(predicate, target)` |
| `languages[]` | reserved (populated by the mobRPG skill) |

Authority: mobRPG is canon. `accepted`/`edited` entities are refreshed from
mobRPG on pull-down; `pending`/`dismissed` entities keep their vault content.

## Relationship Types

Use the most specific type available. Generic types like
`associated_with` or `related_to` add edges without meaning.

| Category | Types |
|----------|-------|
| Kinship | parent_of, sibling_of, spouse_of, betrothed_to, ancestor_of |
| Social | knows, friend_of, rival_of, mentors, trusts, betrayed |
| Power | rules, employs, commands, serves, vassal_of, imprisons |
| Spatial | located_at, headquartered_at, part_of, borders, haunts |
| Possession | owns, created, wields, seeks |
| Knowledge | discovered, conceals, recorded_in, studies |
| Conflict | enemy_of, allied_with, at_war_with, conspires_against |
| Affiliation | member_of, founded, leads, defected_from, infiltrates |
| Supernatural | bound_to, cursed_by, summoned, worships, corrupted_by |
| Temporal | caused, triggered, participated_in, witnessed |
| Economic | trades_with, supplies, finances, indebted_to |
| Event | murdered, poisoned, wounded, rescued, captured, deceived |
| Horror | possessed_by, infected_by, fears, feeds_on |
| Romance | courts, rejected, disguised_as, blackmails |
| Historical | conquered, exiled_from, succeeded, negotiated_with |
| Sci-Fi | uploaded_to, augmented_by, cloned_from, hacked |
| Superhero | alter_ego_of, empowered_by, nemesis_of |

Each type has an `inverse` name. Storage is single-direction only.
If you record `A --[employs]--> B`, the inverse
`B --[employed_by]--> A` is implied. Do NOT store both.

**Symmetric types** (stored once, no direction):
knows, sibling_of, spouse_of, betrothed_to, enemy_of, allied_with,
at_war_with, rival_of, friend_of, borders, trades_with, alter_ego_of,
nemesis_of, negotiated_with

**Genre tags:** Each type carries tags: `universal`, `fantasy`,
`horror`, `scifi`, `superhero`, `historical`, `romance`. Filter
suggestions to match the campaign's genre.

For domain/range constraints and the full inverse name list,
consult `relationship-patterns.md` in the ttrpg-expert skill.

**This table is the authoritative vocabulary.** The machine-readable
export `shared/gm-apprentice-ontology.json` restates these predicates
and adds the mobRPG projection (`mobrpg_event_type` /
`mobrpg_relation_type`) on top; it is generated *from* this table, not
the other way round. `scripts/validate_ontology.py` fails CI when the
two disagree on the **predicate set or the symmetric set**, and checks
the mobRPG projection for internal enum-consistency — it does **not**
cross-check the per-predicate mobRPG mapping values against this table,
because the table does not carry them (that layer is authored in the
export). A vault's `_meta/relationship-types.md` is a genre-filtered
**subset** of this table — never a superset. Predicates that appear
only in a vault copy are drift, not vocabulary.

**Not relationship predicates:** narrative-flow / sequencing is **not**
an edge in this relationship graph and never a `relationships:` block
entry. It is modelled the node-based way (Alexandrian node-based
scenario design; Twine's passage graph): a **`leads_to` frontmatter
field** — an array of wiki-links to the node(s) this one leads to — on
both **Clue** and **Plan** entities. A node with two or more `leads_to`
targets *is* a branch; the branching is the graph structure, so there
is no separate `precedes` (redundant with `leads_to`) or
`alternative_to` (emergent from multiple targets) predicate or field. A
vault vocabulary that lists a `Sequencing` relationship category
invented it — convert those edges to `leads_to` fields.

## Vault Configuration Fields

The vault's `_meta/vault-config.md` file uses YAML frontmatter
for campaign-wide settings. These fields are read by multiple
skills.

### Core fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `gm_apprentice_version` | string | Plugin version this vault was last migrated to. Set by the migration system. Skills compare this to `current_version` in `shared/migrations.md` to detect when migration is needed. |
| `setting_year` | string | In-game date displayed on the published site |

### Publish fields (under `publish:` key)

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `system` | string | Game system identifier (`coc-7e`, `coc-7e-regency`, `gurps-4e`, `dnd-5e-2024`, `pf2e`, `fitd`). Read by publish tool for system-specific rendering. |
| `site_dir` | string | Absolute path to the site repo directory. Read by publish-site skill instead of asking each session. Optional — omit if vault doesn't use the publish tool. |
| `mode` | string | `"player"` or `"full"` — controls GM-only content visibility |
| `exclude_sections` | array | H2 heading names to strip from published output (default: `["GM Notes"]`) |
| `exclude_fields` | array | Frontmatter field names to strip (default: `["secrets", "current_plan", "plan_progress", "gm_notes", "prep_notes"]`) |
| `exclude_dirs` | array | Vault folders to exclude from publishing (default: `["_meta", "_Templates"]`) |
| `theme` | object | Theme configuration: `genre`, `palette`, `fonts`, `campaign_image` |
| `four_oh_four` | object | Custom 404 page: `style`, `message` |
| `overrides` | object | Per-file include/exclude/field overrides |
