"""Session-prep context bundle: the standard read-set in one call.

Emits the digest session-prep's Context Source pattern gathers by
hand every week: latest Wrap-Up, active PC `## Current Status`
blocks, the upcoming session's existing Plan, `_World/_flags.md`
deferred items, and the campaign overview. Read-only, stdlib only.
The skill drills into individual files only where the digest shows
it needs to.

Usage:
  session_context.py VAULT [--session N]

--session N treats N as the just-played session. Otherwise the
campaign overview's `last_session` decides, and failing that the
most recently played session by `play_date` — NOT the highest
`session_number`, which is only a campaign-wide ordinal in vaults
that never restart numbering per chapter (#162). Pre-created
`planned`/`prepped` indexes for the next session are ignored.

Everything downstream is scoped to the selected session's chapter,
so a vault where two chapters each hold a Session 07 pairs the
right wrap-up and plan. Where the answer is ambiguous — a stale
overview pointer, a session number that appears in more than one
chapter — the bundle says so rather than choosing quietly: a wrong
bundle is worse than no bundle, because it reads as authoritative.

Each section is headed with its source path; missing pieces are
reported, not fatal.
