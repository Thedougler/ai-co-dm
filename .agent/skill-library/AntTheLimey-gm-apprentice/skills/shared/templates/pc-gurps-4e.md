## Skills

<!-- Always a single alphabetized table. No category sub-headings.
     Base = unencumbered level (attribute + relative level, plus any
     Talent). Current = what you roll now: Base minus the encumbrance
     level for Climbing, Stealth, Swimming, Judo, and Karate (B17,
     B203) unless a perk such as Armor Familiarity (MA49) offsets it;
     equal to Base for everything else. Refresh Current at wrap-up
     whenever encumbrance changes. -->

### Load-Outs

{Optional. Gear the character carries only sometimes — a returnable
station kit, a heist loadout, a travel pack. On the published sheet
each load-out becomes a toggle that recomputes encumbrance / Move /
Dodge live when switched on; the main Equipment table above is always
carried (`defaultCarried: true`), load-out items default off
(`defaultCarried: false`). Delete this subsection if the PC has none.}

{Contract the renderer parses (`tools/publish/lib/templates/gurps/parse.js`):
this must be a `### Load-Outs` (or `### Loadouts`) subsection **under
`## Equipment`, after the main table** — main items are read only from
above the first `###`. Each load-out is a **bold `**Name**` heading
immediately followed by a table** with `Item`/`Name`, `Weight`, and
`Cost` columns. Gotchas: put no bold text before the first load-out
heading, and no bold inside load-out table cells — either can be
mistaken for a load-out name.}

### Encumbrance

| Level | Max Weight | Move | Dodge |
|-------|-----------|------|-------|
| None (0) | | | |
| Light (1) | | | |
| Medium (2) | | | |
| Heavy (3) | | | |
| X-Heavy (4) | | | |

{To highlight the current level on the published sheet, add a
trailing `*` to its Level cell (e.g. `Light (1) *`). Without a
marker, the published sheet falls back to the `**Enc:**` line in
Current Status, matched by level name.}

## Current Status

{Optional one-line present-tense lede for the published page.}

**Location:** {where the PC is now}
**Condition:** {injuries, HP/FP, conditions}
**Enc:** {current encumbrance level, e.g. Light (1)}
**Carrying:** {narratively-significant items in hand}
**Open threads:**
- {unresolved, forward-looking item}
**Knows (exclusive):** {secret/exclusive knowledge, if any}

{Player-facing; sits outside any gm-only fence. Maintained cumulatively
by session-wrapup (Step 3c): carries unresolved Open threads forward,
adds new, removes resolved. See shared/pc-body-structure.md.}

## Notes

{Player-facing notes. Protected — skills never modify.}

## GM Notes

{Keeper-only notes. Protected — skills never modify.}
