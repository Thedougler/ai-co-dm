# Homebrew Monsters 5e

## Success criteria
- The monster has a memorable fiction signature, a readable role, counterplay, and a reason to exist in this encounter.
- Mechanics use legal 2024/2025 notation, are internally consistent, calibrated against peers, and runnable without hidden arithmetic.
- Output gives the DM decisions to make, not a pile of abilities. Prefer delete and clarify.
- Setting-agnostic paraphrased rules language. Never paste WotC proprietary book text.

## Rules basis and priority order
When facts conflict use: (1) the user brief and table constraints; (2) 2024/2025 core rules and current public SRD; (3) reference-gate peer evidence; (4) numerical chassis and three-round budget; (5) stylistic flourish. State assumptions. Do not silently mix 2014 and 2024 math.

## Gather, then choose the least-complicated path
Briefly gather tier, party size, intended difficulty, environment, role, signature, and complexity. Choose **reskin** when fiction changes but behavior does not; **variant** when one or two hooks change; **full design** only when the decision loop, role, or chassis cannot be expressed by either. Say why the path is sufficient.

## Mandatory reference gate
Before a deliberate homebrew, use `references/reference-gate.md`: inspect one official numerical peer, one role peer, and one mechanic peer (one creature may cover multiple; use at least two independent designs). Summarize patterns in a dossier. Then use `references/chassis-and-budget.md` and `references/audit-and-revise.md`.

## Define the monster before numbers
Write one sentence: “This is a [fantasy] [role] that [signature] to pursue [goal], fears [fear], and gives players [counterplay].” Then fill **Fantasy / Signature / Goal / Fear / Counterplay / Proof**. Proof is the observable tell that makes the signature fair.

## Assign a combat role
Use one primary role. Add a secondary only when complexity is justified. Rank (minion / standard / elite / solo or legendary) is separate from role.

| Role | Function | Typical trade | Expected player response |
|---|---|---|---|
| Ambusher | Hides, strikes, withdraws | Higher burst; lower durability | Reveal it, deny hiding, ready actions |
| Artillery | Ranged pressure | Accuracy/damage for lower HP or AC | Cover, close distance, disrupt positions |
| Bruiser | Dangerous melee | Damage and HP for lower AC, speed, or saves | Kite, control, focus fire |
| Controller | Terrain, movement, conditions | Control for lower direct damage | Break setup, reposition, rescue |
| Defender | Protects allies, holds space | Durability for lower damage | Bypass, shove, isolate, disable |
| Leader | Buffs, heals, commands, repositions | Team power for weaker personal offense | Eliminate or separate from allies |
| Skirmisher | Moves through or around the party | Mobility for reduced durability | Pin it, deny routes, control space |

First turn and default choice must reveal the primary role.

## Decision loop
For every signature feature write **Tell → Threat → Responses → Payoff**. Tell is a visible cue; Threat is what happens if ignored; Responses are at least two viable player answers; Payoff is the benefit, with a cost or opening. Remove features with no response or payoff.

## Numerical chassis: trade, do not stack
Set rank/CR, PB, AC, HP, attack/DC, damage, speed, and saves from the peer dossier. Use formulas and benchmarks in `references/chassis-and-budget.md`; keep one strong axis, one support axis, and a meaningful weakness. Do not stack high AC, HP, broad resistances, immunities, control, damage, and mobility merely because each looks reasonable alone.

- **Three-round offense:** script likely first three rounds, including setup, misses, recharge, reactions, legendary/off-turn actions, and targets. Compare output and control to peers.
- **Defense honesty:** audit effective HP, avoidance, mitigation, saves, immunities, regeneration, healing, and escape together. Every unusual defense needs a bypass, tell, resource, or trade.
- Conditions should create choices or a clock. Prefer slowed movement, narrow disadvantage, exposed positions, resource pressure, or repeat saves over turn deletion. Never spam hard conditions without counterplay.

## Action economy and encounter use
- **Standard:** reliable action or Multiattack; one signature or situational action; zero or one Bonus Action or Reaction.
- **Elite:** more durability or one defensive resource; reliable action plus signature; a Reaction, Bonus Action, or limited off-turn presence; allies or environmental support. Do not simply double every statistic.
- **Solo/legendary:** participate between character turns via Legendary Actions (3 uses/round; each expends one use; options return at start of turn — SRD 5.2.1), Legendary Resistance, Reaction/Bonus Action, lair/terrain, minions, or action-oriented villain phases (Position → Pressure → Desperation). Rate-limit the strongest Legendary Action. Bloodied (≤ half HP) should change decisions, not only add damage.
Do not solve solo play with inflated AC/HP alone. Use lightning rods — groups of weak creatures, fragile burst targets, reachable artillery, expendable lieutenants, visible hazards — so the party's best features work somewhere. Leave immunities blank unless fiction and encounter justify them.

Integrate objective, terrain, allies (usually two or three complementary types), reinforcements, escape, and failure states other than TPK. Trap counterplay must not depend on one check.

## 2024 notation
Use `DC 15`; `+7 to hit`; `Hit: 11 (2d8 + 2) damage`; `Recharge 5–6`; `1/Day`; `Speed 30 feet`; `PB +3`; explicit save/repeat timing; and clear shapes, ranges, targets, durations, and triggers. Label any 2014 recalibration.

## Default output
1. Path chosen and assumptions.
2. Reference-gate dossier and peer patterns (inline, concise).
3. Fiction signature: Fantasy, Signature, Goal, Fear, Counterplay, Proof.
4. Role, rank/CR target, encounter job, and decision loop.
5. Monster stat block or reskin/variant delta.
6. Three-round offense and defense audit summary.
7. Encounter integration: allies, terrain, lightning rods, tells, escape/failure state.
8. Running notes, counterplay, and revision knobs.

## Handoffs
- **theatre-of-the-mind**: spatial prose, tells, and runnable descriptions without a map.
- **dungeon-design**: sites, rooms, hazards, terrain, and encounter architecture.
- **session-beats**: reveal, escalation, pacing, and scene timing.
- **qmd-retrieval**: campaign-vault retrieval; do not invent missing canon.
