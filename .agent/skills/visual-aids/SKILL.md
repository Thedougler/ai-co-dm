description: >-
  Attach, ground, generate, promote, or place a player-safe visual aid for a named campaign owner
  or session moment. Use when a page needs an identity image, prep names a moment to picture, or
  a run guide needs approved images. Not map rendering, spoken narration, or invented faces.

# Visual Aids

The owner's appearance prose is the source of truth. A reference image supports that look; an
illustration depicts one moment and never becomes identity. Spoken `[!narration]` remains the
table's descriptive layer and an image follows the same information boundary.

## Ground

Read the named owner's look, existing image links, campaign style guidance if present, and output
audience. Identify every named thing depicted. A missing look is a stop: ask for appearance or
use prose only. Never infer a PC face, secret fact, pending event, or hidden location from another
page's image.

- **Reference image:** durable identity asset linked on the owner and optionally marked safe for
  players.
- **Illustration:** session-scoped moment stored with session/run-guide material, not identity.
- **Map/source art:** owned by map/layout procedure, not this identity workflow.

## Branch and persist

**Attach** an existing file under `attachments/<campaign>/` (or the established attachment bucket),
link with `![[attachments/...]]`, and list it on the owner only when the identity is truly shared.
Do not mark player-safe by default.

**Mint identity** only when a supplied look exists, no identity file is listed, and an authorized
current task needs one. Keep provisional until DM approval. PC images require player-supplied or
player-approved material. **Mint illustration** only for an explicitly named session moment; keep
it session-scoped and out of identity lists. **Promote/kill** accepted candidates without leaving
competing faces active. **Assemble** only approved player-safe images for entities actually in the
guide; no gallery backfill. On a run-guide **pass 1** beat card, embed an
identity image already listed on that owner's page (`![[attachments/…]]`)
beside Initial Narration or the matching roster heading. Do not mint identity
during beat construction. Spoken `[!narration]` still owns the look.

Ground pixels only in style guidance, the depicted owner's look, and that owner's approved identity
references. Exclude secrets, hidden events, inaccessible pages, unrelated illustrations, and details
outside the output audience. Patch the owner, never a `kind: image` page. Use `obsidian-markdown`,
inspect for visibility leakage, and finish writes with `./scripts/after-write "ground visual aid"`.

If generation is unavailable, leave an unresolved visual-aid request with the full safe prompt;
do not pretend a file exists. `obsidian-leaflet` owns maps and `theatre-of-the-mind` owns spoken
prose.
