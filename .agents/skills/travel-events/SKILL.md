description: >-
  Design a journey leg whose events advance live party threads, factions, resources, or knowledge
  rather than filling time with random encounters. Use for a crossing, voyage, trek, route, or
  "what happens on the way" request. Not vehicle statistics, encounter math, route canon, or
  random-table generation.

# Travel Events

A journey leg changes the situation. Never roll to decide what encounter exists: derive each event
from a live pressure colliding with a fact of the route. Dice may resolve an in-fiction role or
hazard after the event is chosen.

## Ground

Read the campaign `hot.md`, current session prep/log, route and destination owners, live
fronts/quests, PC threads, and route hazards. Establish method, distance/pace from stated facts,
the spotlight PC who is overdue a meaningful moment, pressures that can reach the leg, and one
named steerable landmark. If no specific PC thread, faction pressure, or resource tension reaches
the leg, ask which pressure to pull on; never substitute generic filler.

## Five slots

Fill these in order: (1) **departure cost** — what going now leaves, spends, risks, or owes;
(2) **landmark** — a named thing that can be approached, avoided, or exploited; (3) **events** —
the smallest set of derived beats; (4) **toll** — a concrete cost in time, resources, position,
relationship, information, or danger; (5) **arrival changed** — how the party arrives different.
Choose 1 event for a close leg, 2 for far, 3–4 for very far; add a centerpiece only when travel is
the session's subject. For two or more events include a non-combat beat and do not repeat a
register back-to-back.

```markdown
### Event: title — [combat | social | exploration | hybrid]
**Derivation:** named PC/faction/resource pressure × route fact
**Advances:** thread, relationship, resource, or knowledge
**Spotlight:** named PC and available role
**Before engagement:** independent pressure and visible clue
**Choice surface:** approach, avoid, bargain, exploit, or endure
**Resolution:** check/procedure only after selection; state source/DC and fail-forward
**Toll:** what is spent, lost, owed, revealed, or delayed
**If ignored:** one-step independent consequence
**Loose end:** what remains in motion
```

Offer real PCs roles on multi-event legs (scout/guide, lookout, quartermaster, or a
method-appropriate station). A failed role check becomes the next complication, not a flat penalty.
Do not write a PC decision, feeling, or success in advance.

## Routing

Combat or meaningful social stakes hand to `encounter-prep`; recurring named entities hand to the
owner design skill; pure exploration hazards stay here with actionable feature, resolution, and
fail-forward. Session-specific travel is inline in `templates/Session prep.md` or a run guide;
standing route facts are updated only when canon work is authorized. Do not create a duplicate
one-night event page.

## Completion

Every event has derivation, named connection, advancement, choice surface, toll, independent
if-ignored movement, and loose end. The leg has a landmark and arrival-changed line. Finish an
authorized vault write with `./scripts/after-write "add travel event procedure"`.
