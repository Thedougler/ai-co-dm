## PLACE

Name the space and the walkable plan, not the adventure plot.

Good: `two-storey coaching inn common room with bar north, hearth east, stairs west, open floor center`
Bad: `the party fights goblins here`

Roof rule:

- Exterior yards, streets, roofs, wilderness — roofs on
- Interiors and dungeon rooms — roofs cut away, walls as thick painted bands with a slim outer face so doors and windows read

## BIOME

Climate plus the two or three materials that dominate.

Examples:

- `temperate farmland, packed dirt, oak, red clay tile`
- `cold limestone dungeon, wet flagstone, rusted iron, pale moss`
- `tropical river gorge, basalt, hanging roots, silt water`

## TIME

Default: `bright overcast daylight, even overhead illumination, soft painted form shadow only`

Presets:

- dawn — `low warm sidelight from the east edge, long painted shadows, gold haze`
- dusk — `warm low light from the west edge, cooler fill`
- night — `moonlit blues and practical lantern pools painted into the surfaces`
- planar — name the plane and the light (`fey gold-green, no sun`)

## WEATHER

Default: `clear`

Presets: `light rain sheen on stone`, `fresh snow cover with paths kicked through`, `mist in the low ground only`, `dry heat shimmer off sand`, `ashfall on horizontal surfaces`

## TACTICS

One sentence describing how combat movement feels in this space. The spatial plan (zones, routes, cover positions) lives in ZONES and ROUTES_AND_COVER — TACTICS captures the encounter tempo.

Default if they gave none: `medium skirmish with toe-to-toe and flanking options, cover along the long edges`

Examples:

- `running retreat down a long hall, pursuers closing from behind`
- `defensive stand at a chokepoint with pressure from multiple angles`
- `ambush in dense cover, short sight lines, close-range engagement`
- `open arena, nowhere to hide, forced commitment`

## SCALE

Suggested grid dimensions for the chosen FRAME ratio. Foundry draws the grid — this sets the spatial feel.

| FRAME | Label | Squares (W × H) | Use |
|---|---|---|---|
| portrait 9:16 | tight | 18×32 | single room, boss dais |
| portrait 9:16 | default | 25×45 | standard encounter |
| portrait 9:16 | wide-site | 30×54 | street, camp, small wilderness |
| long-axial | hall | 17×48 | ceremonial hall, canyon |
| long-axial | ship | 12×40 | vessel deck |
| square | arena | 30×30 | arena, tower floor, clearing |
| wide 16:9 | bridge | 45×25 | wide deck, bridge, shoreline |

If they named a grid, use theirs. Match the chosen FRAME ratio.

## STYLE

Default:

`hand-drawn painted Czepeku battlemap, visible ink line, soft watercolor-oil fill, warm technicolor fantasy, high narrative prop density, clear walkable floors, professional VTT cartography`

Presets:

- grim — `same overhead language, dirtier palette, soot, chipped stone, less decorative flourish`
- fey — `same overhead language, luminous plant life, pollen, impossible color`
- ruin — `same overhead language, collapsed roofs as rubble piles, roots through flagstone`
- sci-fi — `same overhead language, panel lines, hazard stripes, clean alloys, Czepeku sci-fi cartography`

Do not switch to photoreal, satellite, Dyson ink-only, or Forgotten Adventures token style unless they named that.

## FRAME

Aspect ratio chosen in the Design step from the tactical footprint. See [design.md — FRAME](design.md#frame) for the selection table.

Default: `tall portrait 9:16 rectangle`

Presets:

- portrait — `tall portrait 9:16 rectangle`
- long-axial — `tall portrait rectangle, approximately 9:24 or fitted to the zone plan`
- square — `square 1:1 rectangle`
- wide — `wide landscape 16:9 rectangle`

## ZONES

One sentence naming the major zones and their spatial relationship, drawn from the Design step's zone plan. Aim for the macro read — what separates at thumbnail.

Examples:

- `Three zones along the long axis: open approach lane south, circular arena center, raised sanctum north`
- `Radial layout: central bonfire clearing, perimeter stall ring, rocky cliff border, river margin south`
- `Two zones divided by a creek ford: dense jungle west, open pebble beach east`

## ROUTES_AND_COVER

One sentence naming the primary route, one alternate route, and the major cover/blockers, drawn from the Design step's route grammar and cover inventory.

Examples:

- `Red carpet central axis as primary route, lateral edge lanes for flanking; equestrian statues as LoS blockers, side recesses for cover`
- `Creek ford as primary crossing, fallen log bridge upstream as alternate; boulders and root clusters for cover on both banks`
- `Central deck spine as primary route, side cabins for flanking; cargo crates and mast base as cover`

## MATERIALS

A ranked material ladder from the Design step. State three or more materials from dominant (most area, neutral) to accent (least area, saturated).

Examples:

- `cream marble floor, red carpet runner, green-gold geometric tile, gold gilding`
- `olive-green grass, warm brown wood and earth, teal-blue water, orange firelight accents`
- `warm timber planking, burgundy carpet and upholstery, cool blue cabin walls, violet arcane glow`

## IDENTITY

One sentence naming the culture, function, or story the map's architecture and props serve, drawn from the Design step's authored identity.

Examples:

- `Ottoman-baroque royal audience hall built for ceremony and processional theatre`
- `Traveling carnival campsite mid-festival, invaded by a creature from the surrounding wilds`
- `Druidic koi shrine and meditation garden maintained by a reclusive order`
