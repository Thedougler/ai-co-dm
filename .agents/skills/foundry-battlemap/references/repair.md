- First-person or hero shot — `Reject scene illustration. Orthographic top-down battlemap only. Camera straight down. No horizon.`

- Photoreal satellite — `Repaint in hand-drawn Czepeku style. Ink line, painted fill, VTT cartography.`
- Ratio mismatch — `Reframe to {FRAME}. Play-space fills the canvas. Keep 9:16 when that is the declared FRAME.`

- Repeated props or tile collage feel — `Vary prop shapes, orientations, and placements. Each element belongs to one specific place.`
- Unreadable clutter — `Open the staging areas. Keep detail on the edges and at landmarks. Movement lanes stay clear.`
- Roof covering an interior the user wanted playable — `Cut the roof away. Interior walls as thick bands. Furniture visible from above.`
- Soft muddy materials — `Sharpen stone, wood grain, and water edges. Keep the same layout.`
