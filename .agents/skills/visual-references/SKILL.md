  Gather visual anchors — reference images and appearance prose — from vault entity pages before
  generating or editing art that depicts them. Fires before any image generation or image edit call
  when the composition includes a vault PC, NPC, monster, location, vehicle, item, or named moment.
  Not for placing finished art on pages; use visual-aids for that.

# Visual References

Generated art preserves the vault's established look when the generation call receives the
owner's **visual anchors**: reference sheets, portraits, tokens, and appearance prose already
on that owner's page. Feed those pixels into the host tool's image-input field. Fall back to
text-only generation only when no usable image exists for the depicted owner.

Anchors lock **identity** — what faces, gear, colours, and silhouettes look like. They do not
constrain composition, camera angle, mood, or cinematic framing. The generation prompt should
carry both: anchored identity facts *and* expressive direction for how the scene is shot.
A flat, clinical prompt produces flat art; a prompt that names a dramatic angle, depth,
atmosphere, and movement produces cinematic art. The anchors keep it accurate; the direction
keeps it alive.

## Workflow

1. **Resolve every depicted owner.** Use `qmd-retrieval` or a known path to find each entity
   that appears in the image. Completion: every named subject has an owner page, or the gap
   is explicitly flagged as missing.

2. **Collect visual anchors.** Read the sections that carry appearance on each owner page:
   `## Visual reference`, `## Art`, the identity image near the title, `[!narration]` body
   when player-safe, and frontmatter `summary` as a last fallback. Resolve each `![[...]]`
   embed to its actual file under `attachments/` as an absolute path. Note user-attached chat
   images as their host token (`[Image #1]` on Grok Build) — those have no vault path.
   Completion: each owner has a list of source lines plus resolved image paths or chat tokens.

3. **Inspect the pixels.** Open each reference image. The pixels are the authority — filename,
   alt text, and prose that contradict what the image actually shows yield to what you see.
   Completion: each reference image has a stated role (e.g. `Delmar identity sheet`,
   `Spoke Ring layout`) and any prose–pixel conflict is resolved in the pixels' favour.

4. **Choose the smallest useful set.** Prefer high-signal anchors in this order:
   - **Reference/design sheets** — identity, outfit, equipment, palette, repeated features.
   - **Portraits** — face, expression, posture, upper-body identity.
   - **Scene or place art** — layout, material, light, environmental silhouette.
   - **Tokens** — low detail; use only when no better identity image exists.

   Keep the strongest anchor for each central subject before adding vibe or layout references.
   Completion: every attached image depicts an owner actually in the composition, and each
   central subject has its strongest available anchor attached.

5. **Feed the host image tool.** Read [.agents/references/image-hosts.md](.agents/references/image-hosts.md)
   for the tool call and parameter mapping on the current host. The image-input field must
   hold the files or tokens — a filename in the prompt text is not the input. Read
   `references/prompt-inventory.md` for the structured brief template. Completion: when
   reference images exist, the tool call's image-input field contains them; when none exist,
   the call is text-only.

6. **Stop on missing anchors.** If a known entity has neither appearance prose nor a usable
   reference image, ask for visual guidance or create the missing design through the
   appropriate craft path before generating. Completion: every depicted canon owner is
   grounded in vault anchors, not invented.

## Scope boundary

This skill gathers and feeds visual anchors. It does not decide whether to generate, judge
the result, place finished files, or update owner pages. After generation, hand off to
`visual-aids` when the result needs to be attached, promoted, or embedded in the vault.
