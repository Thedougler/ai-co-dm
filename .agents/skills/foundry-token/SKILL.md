# Foundry token

Two phases. **Art** produces an accepted **stand** — a finished source image
with stable identity, **crop-safe** composition (subject and details survive a
centered circular crop), a **thumbnail-readable** silhouette, and a flat **key**
color filling every pixel that is not the subject. **Finalization** runs
`./scripts/foundry-token` once; the script is the single source of truth for
pixel operations (chroma-key the stand onto transparency, centered square
cover-crop, resize, anti-aliased circular alpha mask). The accepted stand
remains unchanged. The final asset is a PNG with RGBA alpha, a square canvas,
the subject isolated, and transparency everywhere else inside and outside the
circle.

## Process

### 1. Classify

Decide whether the request needs new art or finalization of an existing image.
For an existing local image, use its exact path. Identify the owner, source
image (or the need to generate one), intended output path, and target size (see
[references/foundry.md](references/foundry.md) for sizing).

**Done when** owner, source, output path, and size are known.

### 2. Generate and iterate

When no accepted stand exists, generate the source image with the image tool.
Read [.agents/references/image-hosts.md](.agents/references/image-hosts.md) for which
tool to call on the current host.
Use [references/prompt.md](references/prompt.md) for the prompt template and
[references/slots.md](references/slots.md) for slot guidance. Generate a square
source whenever possible.

Keep the subject centered inside the inner 90% of the frame — **crop-safe**.
Paint the subject on a flat **key** color from
[references/slots.md](references/slots.md). Fill every corner. Save the
accepted stand as PNG so the key field stays flat.

Choose the camera from the request: a readable portrait or action composition
for stand tokens, overhead only when the user asks for top-down art.

Iterate until the stand is accepted: identity stable, composition **crop-safe**,
silhouette **thumbnail-readable**, anatomy and gear clean, key field clean
around the silhouette. Repair with [references/repair.md](references/repair.md)
before finalizing.

**Done when** the stand is crop-safe, thumbnail-readable, identity-stable, and
the key color is a clean field around the silhouette.

### 3. Finalize

Run from the vault root:

```bash
./scripts/foundry-token \
  "/path/to/accepted-stand.webp" \
  "artifacts/tokens/owner-token.png" \
  --size 512
```

The command keys the stand color to transparency, then applies the circular
mask. The output argument is optional; without it the command writes beside the
source as `SOURCE-stem-token.png`. Add `--key lime` when the stand used lime.
Add `--margin 0.03` when the stand needs transparent breathing space around the
circle. Add `--force` when intentionally replacing an existing final PNG.

If the command reports a painted background, replace the stand background with
the key color and run it again. If the center crop loses a meaningful feature,
fix the source composition and run the command again.

**Done when** the command reports `created`, the output exists, and the source
file is unchanged.

### 4. Verify

Open the final PNG and check:

- Only the subject is opaque. Sky, ground, and leftover key color are gone
  inside the circle as well as outside it.
- Four corners show transparency (the script validates PNG format, RGBA mode,
  dimensions, circular alpha, and interior isolation).
- Identifying features stay inside the circle edge.
- The art is **thumbnail-readable** at token size.

**Done when** machine checks pass and the isolated subject reads at thumbnail
size inside the circle.

### 5. Deliver

Report the final PNG path and one concise import line: file path, grid
footprint, pixel size, subject isolated on circular transparent alpha, and
facing when relevant. Keep the accepted stand path for future iterations.

**Done when** the user has the file and can identify its import size and framing.
