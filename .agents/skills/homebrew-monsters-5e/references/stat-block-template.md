# Stat-block template

Use original names and concise paraphrase. Replace bracketed fields; delete fields that do not matter. Every feature must state timing, range, targets, save/attack, effect, duration, and counterplay where relevant.

## 2024 notation examples
- `Armor Class 16 (natural armor)`
- `Hit Points 68 (8d8 + 32)`
- `Speed 30 feet, climb 20 feet`
- `+6 to hit`, `DC 14 Dexterity saving throw`, `Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) slashing damage`
- `Recharge 5–6`; `1/Day`; `at the end of its turns`; `until the end of its next turn`
- `60-foot Cone`; `15-foot Cube`; `one target it can see`; `each creature in the area`

## Running the Monster
Design-time fields — work through these during creation, then distribute into the wiki note.

### Standalone creature → `templates/Monster.md`

Linear layout: H1 → image → `[!narration]` → statblock fence → `---` → Behavior (list items `- **Label.**`) → Tactics (list items `- **Label.**`) → `---` → Art.

- **Opening tell and preferred position:** [ ] → Tactics: **Signs**, **Instincts**
- **Default choice:** [ ] → Tactics: **Tactics**
- **If pressured / if signature is answered:** [ ] → Tactics: **Tactics**, **Weaknesses**
- **Target priority:** [ ] → Tactics: **Instincts**
- **Three-round script:** [round 1 / round 2 / round 3] → stays in design conversation
- **Resource tracking:** [recharge, pool, reaction, phase] → stays in design conversation
- **Player-facing counterplay:** [at least two answers] → Tactics: **Weaknesses**
- **Retreat, surrender, or failure state:** [ ] → Tactics: **Aftermath**
- **Encounter integration:** [allies, terrain, lightning rods, reinforcements] → Behavior: **Habitat**, **Social Structure**

### NPC with combat form → `templates/NPC.md`

When statblocks embed in an NPC file, the same design fields distribute differently:

- **Opening tell and preferred position:** [ ] → `## Running [Name]`
- **Default choice, pressure response:** [ ] → `## Running [Name]` subsections
- **Target priority, counterplay:** [ ] → `## Running [Name]`
- **Encounter rule (which statblock to use):** [ ] → `# Combat` preamble
- **Stage/form conditions:** [ ] → one statblock fence per condition under `# Combat`
- **Retreat, surrender, failure state:** [ ] → `## Running [Name]`
- **Encounter integration:** [ ] → Relationships table + Running section
- **Three-round script, resource tracking:** → stays in design conversation
