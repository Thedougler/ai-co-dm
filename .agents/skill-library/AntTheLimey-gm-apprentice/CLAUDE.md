# CLAUDE.md — gm-apprentice

Context for Claude sessions working in this repository.

## What this is

A Claude Code plugin marketplace at `AntTheLimey/gm-apprentice` containing
nine TTRPG Game Master skills:

- `ttrpg-expert` — rules, content generation, session planning
- `the-midwife` — guided adventure creation through creative conversation
- `campaign-organizer` — vault structure, knowledge graph metadata
- `campaign-qa` — canon auditing, graph health checks
- `session-prep` — between-session preparation and reconciliation
- `session-play` — at-the-table GM support (speed-optimised)
- `session-wrapup` — post-session processing, entity creation, recaps
- `vault-ingest` — ingestion of old campaign materials into the vault
- `publish-site` — publish campaign vault as a static website

Supported systems: CoC 7e (+ Regency Cthulhu variant), GURPS 4e, FitD,
D&D 5e 2024, Pathfinder 2e (Remaster).

## ⚠️ Copyright compliance — read before touching any system content

This repository redistributes TTRPG content under multiple licenses.
**Misusing licensed content exposes the project to takedown requests and
puts the author at personal legal risk.** Every Claude session working in
this repo must treat copyright compliance as the highest-priority rule,
above all other conventions.

### The licenses in play

| System | License | What's allowed |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| CoC 7e / BRP | [BRP ORC License](https://www.chaosium.com/orclicense) | Mechanics, stat blocks, generic content. No proprietary Chaosium IP (Arkham, Lovecraft Country NPCs, published adventures, flavour text) |
| D&D 5e (2024) | [CC-BY 4.0 SRD](https://dnd.wizards.com/resources/systems-reference-document) | Anything in the 5.2 SRD with attribution. No content outside the SRD |
| FitD | [CC-BY 3.0](https://bladesinthedark.com/about-the-dark) | Blades in the Dark rules with attribution. No Deep Cuts, no publisher-specific content |
| PF2e (Remaster) | [ORC License](https://paizo.com/orclicense) | Paraphrased mechanics, names, and game math from ORC-stamped sources (via `~/PROJECTS/reference-srds/pf2e-orc-dataset/`). No verbatim rules text, no Golarion Reserved Material, never the CUP-licensed vault |
| GURPS 4e | [SJG Online Policy](http://www.sjgames.com/general/online_policy.html) | **Names, point costs, short notes only.** No full rule text, no full character builds, no tables reproduced verbatim |

**Full license texts and attribution requirements live in `ATTRIBUTION.md`.
Read it before adding any content derived from a published source.**

### Hard rules

1. **Never reproduce rule text verbatim** from any system's core book
   unless the SRD or ORC license explicitly covers it. Paraphrase
   mechanics in your own words, or cite short quoted fragments.

2. **GURPS is the strictest** — SJG Online Policy only permits "names,
   point costs, short notes" in free fan aids. This means:
   - ✅ `Broadsword [8 pts] — Swing weapon, Reach 1`
   - ❌ Full advantage/skill descriptions copied from Basic Set
   - ❌ Long tables of weapon stats reproduced wholesale
   - If in doubt, summarize and cite the page reference — don't transcribe

3. **Update `ATTRIBUTION.md` in the same commit** as any licensed-content
   addition. Every new file sourced from a licensed document needs a
   line item recording where it came from, what license applies, and
   what was done to it.

4. **When in doubt, ask the user.** Do not guess at what's permissible.
   Copyright mistakes are not cheap to fix — an unclear commit may need
   to be reverted, the content rewritten, and the history rewritten.

5. **Personal reference files are gitignored** under
   `skills/ttrpg-expert/systems/*/personal/`. These are the user's local
   working copies of full rulebooks. **Never commit files from these
   directories** — they're private and licensed for personal use only.

### When generating new content

- Original content you write from scratch is fine and desirable
- Mechanics summaries in your own words are fine
- Pointing users at page references in their own books is fine
- Copying and pasting more than a sentence or two from a source is not fine
- Adding a new licensed source? Add its license to `ATTRIBUTION.md` first

## Repository structure

- `skills/` — one directory per skill (`SKILL.md` + `references/`)
- `docs/` — user-facing documentation
- `tests/` — schema validation, benchmark infrastructure, compaction tests
- `scripts/` — utility scripts (not user-facing)
- `tools/` — standalone tools (e.g., future `tools/publish/` npm package)
- `.claude-plugin/` — plugin metadata (`plugin.json`, `marketplace.json`)
- `ATTRIBUTION.md` — copyright compliance records (authoritative)
- `README.md` — installation and overview
- `ROADMAP.md` — force-ranked backlog (see workflow below)

## Schema changes

**Before adding, renaming, or removing any frontmatter field**, follow the
checklist in `docs/schema-change-procedure.md`. This covers templates,
shared templates, skill references, consuming code, validation, migration
entries, and versioning. Skipping steps causes migration failures.

Note: `.claude/` is gitignored (local Claude Code settings and worktrees).
`docs/superpowers/` and `docs/plans/` are gitignored (local specs and plans).
`skills/ttrpg-expert/systems/*/personal/` are gitignored (user's private
licensed reference files — see copyright rules above).

## Roadmap workflow

**Before planning new work**, read `ROADMAP.md` to check current priorities
and see if the work is already listed.

**If work isn't listed but should be**, add it using the formula:

```text
Score = (Impact × 2 + Urgency) / Effort
```

Keep the list sorted by score (highest first).

**When completing work**, strike through the item with `~~` on both sides
and move it to the "Completed" section with a PR number or commit SHA.

## Commit conventions

- **Never add `Co-Authored-By` trailers** to commits
- **Never mention Claude, AI, or LLM tools** in commit messages or PR bodies
- Match existing commit style — terse, sentence-case, no conventional-commits
  prefixes
- Prefer small, focused commits over batched changes

## Development workflow

Every non-trivial change follows this sequence:

1. **Branch** — create a feature branch from main
2. **Implement** — write code and tests for any scripts or tooling
3. **Version bump** — bump `version` in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`
   (patch by default unless the user specifies otherwise)
4. **CHANGELOG** — add a categorized entry (Added/Changed/Fixed/Removed)
   under the new version in `CHANGELOG.md`, following the existing format
5. **Local review** — dispatch the code-reviewer agent against the branch
   before pushing; fix all findings
6. **Ask before pushing** — present a summary of what will be pushed and
   wait for explicit user confirmation before running `git push` or
   `gh pr create`. Never push or open a PR autonomously.
7. **Push + PR** — push the branch and open a PR to main
8. **CI** — wait for all checks to pass
9. **CodeRabbit** — check for unresolved CodeRabbit comments on the PR;
   address all findings before merging
10. **Merge** — the release workflow creates the tag and GitHub Release
    with skill zips automatically

**What counts as trivial:** single file, 1-2 lines, user explicitly says
"push to main." Everything else gets a branch and PR.

**Test requirements:** at minimum, run `python3 scripts/validate_schema.py`
and verify markdown lint passes. For script or tooling changes, verify the
scripts work locally (e.g., `./scripts/build-skill-zips.sh` produces 8
valid zips). For publish tool changes, run the publish tool test suite.

## Skill edits

- **Use Opus** for writing new skill content, priming prose, or
  routing design. **Sonnet is fine** for mechanical edits
  (replacements, references, structural changes) when the exact
  content is specified in a plan or instructions.
- **Run `skill-creator` validation** before committing skill changes.
  **CI does not run this** — schema + markdownlint passing does *not* cover it.
  Run it manually and never defer it: it has no automated backstop, so a
  deferred skill-creator check simply never happens. "CI is green" ≠ "validated."
- `SKILL.md` is the routing layer — keep it concise
- Detailed content belongs in `skills/*/references/`
- **Inline vs extract threshold:** Every file read costs ~90 tokens of
  fixed overhead (tool call + wrapper + line numbers). Don't extract
  content to a shared file if it's always needed and short (<500 bytes).
  Do extract if the content is large (>2KB) or conditional (<50% of
  invocations). Extracting small always-needed content (like version
  checks) makes things slower and more expensive — proven by Phase 1
  proof runs.

## Testing

- Schema validation: `python3 scripts/validate_schema.py`
- Benchmarks live in `tests/benchmark-campaign/` and `tests/benchmark-questions/`
  — do not delete these
- One benchmark run is enough; fix issues before benchmarking; use A/B
  comparisons rather than absolute scores

### Benchmark and proof-run discipline

When running benchmark queries, proof-of-improvement runs, or any
multi-query test suite via subagents:

1. **Subagents write their own results to disk.** Each benchmark or
   proof-run subagent must write its complete response file (frontmatter
   metrics + full response text) to the correct path as its final
   action. This ensures the result exists on disk even if the parent
   session never reads the agent's return value. The parent then stamps
   `total_tokens` and `wall_clock_ms` from the agent metadata (the
   agent leaves these as 0 since it can't see its own usage).
2. **Every run produces a `summary.md`** at the top of its results
   directory with a per-query metrics table for fast comparison.
3. **Token counts alone do not prove quality.** Proof runs must
   preserve full response text so that output quality can be compared
   against the baseline, not just cost.
4. **Present results to the user for review** before drawing
   conclusions or proceeding to the next step.
