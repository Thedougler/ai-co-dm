# Schema Reference — Frontmatter Fields per Entity Type

This file lists the frontmatter fields that `gm-apprentice-publish`
reads when generating site pages. Fields marked **Required** must
be present for the page to render correctly. Fields marked
**Optional** are used when present and silently ignored when absent.

The tool reads the `type` frontmatter field first to decide which
template to use. If `type` is missing or does not match a known
value, the entity falls through to the smart wiki fallback.

---

## Dedicated Templates

These entity types have purpose-built page layouts.

### PC (Player Character)

`type: pc`

| Field | Status | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| `occupation` | Optional | Background or character class |
| `status` | Optional | active, retired, dead, npc |
| `key_traits` | Optional | List of defining traits (shown on PC card and landing page) |
| `player_name` | Optional | Real-world player name |
| `portrait` | Optional | Path relative to vault root (e.g. `_attachments/characters/slug.jpg`) |
| `display_meta` | Optional | Ordered list of frontmatter field names to show in the meta row (defaults to `[occupation, age, nationality]`) |

**Layout — single panel vs. tabbed:** When no story companion file
exists, the PC template renders body content as collapsible accordion
sections (H2 headings become panel titles). When a story companion
file is present, the page switches to a two-tab layout:

- **Character Sheet** tab — the accordion layout as above
- **Story** tab — prose flow of the story file (see below)

Direct-link to a tab via URL hash: `#sheet` (default) or `#story`.

**Story companion files:** Discovered by naming convention —
`{Name}_Story.md` in the same directory as the PC file. The file
must have `type: character-story` frontmatter. Story files do not
get their own published page; they are consumed by the parent PC
template. `GM Notes` sections in story files are stripped by the
standard filtering pipeline before rendering. Wiki-links in story
prose resolve to published pages.

**Story rendering:** Session headings with narrative paragraphs
beneath them. No accordion — the content flows as continuous prose.

### NPC (Non-Player Character)

`type: npc`

| Field | Status | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| `occupation` | Optional | Role label (e.g. "Patron", "Antagonist", "Shopkeeper") |
| `nationality` | Optional | Origin or nationality |
| `status` | Optional | active, dead, missing, unknown |
| `age` | Optional | Character age |
| `rank` | Optional | Military or organizational rank |
| `portrait` | Optional | Path relative to vault root |

Body content renders below the header card. The `Relationships`
section in the body is excluded from the public site by default
(see `excludeSections` in `vault.config.json`).

---

### Location

`type: location`

| Field | Status | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| `location_type` | Optional | Type label (e.g. "City", "Building", "Wilderness") |
| `parent_location` | Optional | `[[wiki-link]]` to the containing location — also the grouping key for the Locations listing page; entries without it group by `location_type`, else under "Other" |
| `security_level` | Optional | Security descriptor (rendered as badge) |
| `atmosphere` | Optional | Tone or mood of the location (rendered as badge) |
| `portrait` | Optional | Path relative to vault root |

The parent location renders as a breadcrumb above the page title
if the linked note can be resolved.

---

### Creature

`type: creature`

| Field | Status | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| `hp` | Optional | Hit points or equivalent |
| `dr` | Optional | Damage resistance or armour value |
| `speed` | Optional | Movement rate |
| `sm` | Optional | Size Modifier |
| `st` | Optional | Strength |
| `dx` | Optional | Dexterity |
| `iq` | Optional | Intelligence |
| `ht` | Optional | Health |
| `creature_type` | Optional | Type label (rendered as badge) |
| `threat_level` | Optional | Threat rating (rendered as badge) |
| `abilities` | Optional | List of special abilities (rendered as bullet list) |
| `weaknesses` | Optional | List of vulnerabilities (rendered as bullet list) |
| `portrait` | Optional | Path relative to vault root |

The creature template renders a combat stat block at the top of
the page followed by body content. Intended for in-session lookup
during encounters.

---

### Item

`type: item`

| Field | Status | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| `damage` | Optional | Damage value or dice |
| `dr` | Optional | Damage resistance (for armour items) |
| `weight` | Optional | Weight in relevant units |
| `cost` | Optional | Cost in campaign currency |
| `tl` | Optional | Tech Level |
| `item_type` | Optional | Type label (rendered as badge) |
| `rarity` | Optional | Rarity level (rendered as badge) |
| `current_holder` | Optional | `[[wiki-link]]` to current owner |
| `origin` | Optional | `[[wiki-link]]` to origin location or entity |
| `portrait` | Optional | Path relative to vault root |

Body content follows the stat block.

---

### Faction / Organization

`type: faction` or `type: organization`

Both factions and organizations use the same template.

| Field | Status | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| `faction_type` | Optional | Type label (rendered as badge; groups the Factions listing — military, corporation, government get curated headings; legacy camelCase factionType is honored) |
| `alignment` | Optional | Faction alignment (rendered as badge) |
| `goals` | Optional | List of faction goals |
| `leadership` | Optional | `[[wiki-link]]` to leader entity |
| `territory` | Optional | `[[wiki-link]]` to home location |
| `resources` | Optional | Brief description of faction resources |
| `portrait` | Optional | Path relative to vault root (faction banner or insignia) |

The faction page also performs a reverse lookup: any entity in
the vault with a `member_of` or `assigned_to` relationship
pointing to this faction will be listed in a **Members** section.

---

### Event

`type: event`

| Field | Status | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| `event_type` | Optional | Type label (e.g. "battle", "discovery", "betrayal", "ritual") |
| `date` | Optional | In-game date of the event |
| `location` | Optional | `[[wiki-link]]` to where the event occurred |
| `participants` | Optional | List of participants — each entry can be `[[Entity]] (role)`, `[[Entity\|Display]] (role)`, or plain text |
| `outcome` | Optional | What resulted — rendered as a highlighted callout box |
| `portrait` | Optional | Path relative to vault root (scene art) |

The event template renders a header card with the title, date, and
location (linked if resolvable), followed by an outcome callout and
a participants list. Participants with `[[wiki-links]]` are resolved
to clickable links. Role annotations in parentheses are preserved
after the name.

Body content renders below the participants section.

---

### Heritage

`type: heritage`

| Field | Status | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| `lifespan_range` | Optional | Two-element array `[min, max]` — rendered as "min–max years" in the stat card |
| `maturity_age` | Optional | Age at which members reach adulthood — rendered in the stat card |
| `average_height` | Optional | Typical height range as a string (e.g. "5'6\"–6'2\"") — rendered in the stat card |
| `notable_traits` | Optional | List of defining traits — rendered as badge pills below the header |
| `portrait` | Optional | Path relative to vault root |

The heritage template renders a stat card (lifespan, maturity,
height) beside the portrait, with notable traits as badge pills
below. Body content follows, then the relationship graph and
context sidebar.

---

### World Domain

`type: world_domain`

| Field | Status | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| `summary` | Optional | One-line description rendered as a subtitle below the page title |
| `rules` | Optional | List of rule objects with `rule` (or `id`) field — rendered in a sidebar panel |
| `publish_rules` | Optional | Set to `false` to suppress the rules sidebar even when `rules` is present |

The world domain template renders body content with an optional
rules sidebar. Each rule object's `rule` (or `id`) field is
displayed as a list item.

**World flags** (`type: world_flags`) are excluded from the
published site entirely — `_flags.md` is an internal tracking
file and is skipped during build.

---

## Smart Wiki Fallback

Any entity whose `type` does not match a dedicated template
renders using the smart wiki template. This template reads all
frontmatter fields and displays them as metadata badges above
the body content. No fields are required beyond `name`.

The types listed below are common smart-wiki entities.
Dedicated templates for them will be added in later versions.
Any other unrecognised `type` value also falls through here.

### Clue

`type: clue`

Badges rendered: `clue_type`, `reliability`, `found_by`

### Document

`type: document`

Badges rendered: `document_type`, `author`, `classification`,
`date_written`

### Chapter

`type: chapter`

Badges rendered: `sort_order`

A published chapter page is required for the Story page's Campaign
Saga: a recap surfaces only when its session, its chapter, and the
wrap-up (`type: session_wrap`) all publish.

### Session

`type: session`

Badges rendered: `session_number`, `play_date`, `status`,
`stage`

A published session page drives the landing "Latest Session" recap
and the "NPCs/Locations in Play" widgets. The wrap-up
(`type: session_wrap`) supplies the recap text, but nothing surfaces
unless the session — and, for the Campaign Saga, its chapter — publish
too.

### Scene

`type: scene`

Badges rendered: `scene_type`, `status`

---

## Common fields

These fields are read by all templates if present:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `aliases` | List of alternate names used for wiki-link resolution |
| `canon_status` | DRAFT / AUTHORITATIVE / SUPERSEDED / STUB — renders a canon status badge (see below) |
| `source_confidence`, `confidence` | Legacy names for `canon_status` — honored at read time for unmigrated vaults, never written |
| `superseded_by` | `[[wiki-link]]` — SUPERSEDED entities redirect links to this target |
| `relationships` | List of `{ target, type, description }` objects rendered as a Relationships section |
| `tags` | Used for NPC importance scoring on the landing page; not rendered on entity pages |

### Canon Status Badges

The publish tool reads `canon_status` from entity frontmatter
(falling back to the legacy `source_confidence`, then
`confidence`, for vaults that haven't run the 1.8.0 migration)
and renders a badge next to the page title:

| Value | Badge | Appearance |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| AUTHORITATIVE | None | Normal page (no badge) |
| DRAFT | "Draft" | Amber badge — content not yet confirmed |
| STUB | "Stub" | Warning-coloured badge — placeholder only |
| SUPERSEDED | "Superseded" | Grey badge — replaced by newer content |

SUPERSEDED entities also redirect wiki-links to their
`superseded_by` target when that target exists in the site.

**Page title:** The page title is always derived from the vault
filename (without the `.md` extension), not from frontmatter. To
change a page's title, rename the file. To make a page findable
under alternate names, use the `aliases` field.

---

## Portrait paths

Portrait paths must be relative to the vault root and use
forward slashes. The `attachmentsDir` field in `vault.config.json`
sets the base folder (default: `_attachments`).

Example vault frontmatter:
```yaml
portrait: "_attachments/characters/alice-morgan.jpg"
```

Supported formats: `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.webp`, `.gif`,
`.svg`, `.avif`.

If a portrait file cannot be found at the given path, the portrait
area is hidden rather than showing a broken image.

---

## Site-level configuration fields

These fields live in `_meta/vault-config.md` under the `publish:` key
and affect the whole site rather than individual entity pages. See
`configuration.md` for the full vault-config reference.

| Field | Key path | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `system` | `publish.system` | Game system identifier. Expected values: `coc-7e`, `coc-7e-regency`, `gurps-4e`, `dnd-5e-2024`, `pf2e`, `fitd`. Selects the PC character-sheet renderer at build time; matched case-insensitively, with aliases (`coc`, `gurps`, `dnd`, `pathfinder`, `blades`). An unrecognised or absent value falls back to the generic PC layout. |
