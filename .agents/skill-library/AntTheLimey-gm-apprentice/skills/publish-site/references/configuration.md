# Configuration Reference

Publish settings are split between two files. Understanding
which file owns which setting prevents confusion.

## `_meta/vault-config.md` (in the vault)

YAML frontmatter under `publish:`. This is the authoritative
source for content filtering and theming. Values here take
precedence over `vault.config.json` for scalar settings; the
exclude **lists** union across both files rather than shadowing
each other — see § Precedence.

| Setting | Key path | Description |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| Publish mode | `publish.mode` | `player` or `full` |
| Excluded sections | `publish.exclude_sections` | H2 headings to strip (default: `["GM Notes", "DM Notes", "Player Notes", "Source References", "Reconciliation Context", "Handoff to Reconcile"]`) |
| Excluded callouts | `publish.exclude_callouts` | Strip Obsidian callouts (`> [!type]`): `true` for all, or an array of types (default: `false`; scaffolded sites set `true`) |
| Excluded fields | `publish.exclude_fields` | Frontmatter fields to strip (default: `["secrets", "current_plan", "plan_progress", "gm_notes", "prep_notes"]`) |
| Excluded directories | `publish.exclude_dirs` | Vault directories to skip (default: `["_meta", "_Templates"]`) |
| Landing NPC count | `publish.landing.max_npcs` | Cards in "NPCs in Play" (default: `6`) |
| Landing location count | `publish.landing.max_locations` | Cards in "Latest Locations" (default: `4`) |
| Landing recency window | `publish.landing.recency_window` | How many recent sessions feed the scoring (default: `3`) |
| Featured NPCs | `publish.landing.featured_npcs` | Pin NPCs to the front of their section, in order (see § Pinning landing entries) |
| Featured locations | `publish.landing.featured_locations` | Same, for locations |
| Quick links | `publish.landing.quick_links` | A short row of pinned links near the top of the landing page |
| Campaign image | `publish.theme.campaign_image` | Vault-relative path to hero image |
| Theme palette | `publish.theme.palette` | Colour scheme (primary, accent, background, text) |
| Theme fonts | `publish.theme.fonts` | Heading and body font families |
| Theme genre | `publish.theme.genre` | Genre tag for theming hints |
| 404 message | `publish.four_oh_four.message` | Custom in-world 404 text |
| Per-file field overrides | `publish.overrides.fields` | Re-admit an excluded frontmatter field for one named file (see § Per-file field overrides) |
| Section index titles | `publish.section_titles` | Override h1 titles on the Locations/Factions/Items/Creatures index pages |
| Exclude drafts | `publish.exclude_drafts` | When `true`, DRAFT entities are excluded entirely (default: `false`) |
| Image optimization | `publish.images` | Opt-in WebP re-encoding of copied images (default: off) |
| Section banners | `publish.banners` | Hero image or clickable map at the top of a section index |
| Locations grouping | `publish.locations` | Pivot the Locations index on a `location_type` (default: genre-derived) |
| CoC sheet crest | `publish.sheet_crest` | Vault-relative image for the Order crest / wax seal in the CoC investigator-sheet masthead. Renders only when set and the image exists. Campaign-wide — there is no per-PC override |
| Setting year | `setting_year` | Fallback in-game date on the landing page (used only when the campaign overview has no `current_game_date`) |

> **Landing page state.** The landing hero (in-game date, session count) and the
> *Latest Session* card are driven by the **`_Campaign` overview frontmatter** —
> `current_game_date`, `sessions_played`, `last_session`, `last_play_date` — which
> the `session-wrapup` skill keeps current. The overview is located by its
> `type: campaign_overview` frontmatter (not by filename, so a renamed overview
> still resolves) and is read from the full vault corpus, so it applies even
> though the overview is normally excluded from publishing. `setting_year` and
> `total_sessions` remain as fallbacks when those fields are absent.

### Section index titles

Section index pages (Locations, Factions, Items, Creatures) use neutral
titles by default. Genre presets restyle them: `military` gives "Theater
of Operations", "Intelligence Briefing", "Armory & Acquisitions",
"Bestiary"; `scifi` gives "Star Charts", "Powers & Interests",
"Hardware & Equipment", "Xenofauna"; `fantasy` and `horror` use
"Bestiary" for creatures. Override any of them in
`_meta/vault-config.md`:

```yaml
publish:
  section_titles:
    locations: "Star Charts"
    factions: "Powers & Syndicates"
```

Valid keys: `locations`, `factions`, `items`, `creatures`.

### Theme genre presets

`publish.theme.genre` accepts: `fantasy` (aliases: `adventure`),
`horror` (`gothic`, `cthulhu`), `noir` (`industrial`, `heist`),
`military` (`tactical`, `modern`), and `scifi` (`sci-fi`,
`science-fiction`, `space`, `space-opera`, `space-noir`). A preset
supplies the palette and fonts; a custom `publish.theme.palette`
overrides the preset colors. A live gallery of all presets built over
the same campaign is published from the repo's theme-showcase workflow.

### Image optimization

Off by default — images are copied byte-for-byte. When enabled, PNG and
JPEG attachments are re-encoded to WebP as they're copied, and the
`<img src>` is written to match:

```yaml
publish:
  images:
    optimize: true    # default false
    format: webp      # the only supported target today
    max_width: 1600   # 0 disables resizing
    quality: 82
```

Needs the `cwebp` binary on `PATH` (`brew install webp`, `apt install
webp`). Without it the build warns and copies the originals, so a
missing encoder never breaks a build. Images that would grow when
re-encoded keep their original bytes; SVG, GIF, WebP and AVIF are always
passed through. On a portrait-heavy campaign this is the biggest single
weight on the site — one real vault went from 164 MB to 11 MB.

### Section index banners

A hero image or clickable map at the top of a section index. Either drop
a `_banner.*` file into the section's vault folder
(`Locations/_banner.svg`), or name one explicitly:

```yaml
publish:
  banners:
    locations:
      image: _attachments/sector-map.webp
      link: _attachments/sector-map.svg    # optional click-through
      alt: Sector 7-G star chart
    factions: _attachments/factions-hero.svg   # shorthand
```

Keys are output directories (`locations`, `factions`), not vault
folders. Config wins over the conventional file.

An **SVG with no `link` is inlined**, so its internal `<a>` elements stay
live — a star map whose nodes link to entity pages keeps working. Write
those hrefs relative to the index page (`corwin-system.html`). Anything
with a `link` renders as an `<img>` inside an `<a>`, since an outer
anchor would swallow an SVG's own links.

Assets are copied to `docs/images/banners/<section>/`, namespaced so two
sections' `_banner.*` files can't collide. A path resolving outside the
vault, or a missing file, warns and is skipped rather than failing the
build.

### Locations index grouping

When a campaign's geography funnels through one political root
(`Republic → Sector → System → planet`), the default listing is a single
deep tree. Pivot grouping makes each mid-level node its own section
instead:

```yaml
publish:
  locations:
    group_by: system                    # matched against location_type
    ungrouped_label: Deep Space & Routes
```

`group_by` is a case-insensitive substring of `location_type`, so
`system` matches both `system` and `star system`. The `scifi` genre
defaults it to `system`; every other genre leaves grouping off. Set
`group_by: false` to turn a genre default back off.

Locations with no matching ancestor collect under `ungrouped_label`. The
scaffolding above the pivot (the Republic, the Sector) is demoted to a
small context caption rather than rendered as tree rows. Grouping is
skipped — falling back to the flat view — when fewer than two locations
match the pivot, since one section is not a grouping.

### Pinning landing entries

The landing page picks NPCs and locations by a recency score — how often
an entity appears in the last few sessions. That is a reasonable default
and a poor editor: a GM who knows which five NPCs matter this session
cannot express it, and entities tied on score are separated by nothing
more meaningful than where their files sit on disk.

`featured_npcs` / `featured_locations` pin entries to the front of their
section, in the order listed, with recency filling whatever slots remain
up to `max_npcs` / `max_locations`. A pinned entity appears even if it
scores nothing — an NPC no session has mentioned yet is still featurable.

```yaml
publish:
  landing:
    max_npcs: 6
    featured_npcs: ["Hugh_Cavendish", "Margaret_Cavendish"]
    featured_locations: ["Cavendish_Compound"]
    quick_links: ["Calcutta_City_Map", "Calcutta_Season_Calendar"]
```

Name entities the same way a wiki-link does — the filename form, not the
display title. A name that resolves to no published page prints a build
warning rather than being dropped in silence; if it is spelled right, the
page is probably excluded from the site.

Entities left unpinned still sort by score, and ties now break by title,
so the selection is at least reproducible and explainable.

### Per-file field overrides

`exclude_fields` strips a frontmatter field from every page. When one
page needs a stripped field back, name that page under
`publish.overrides.fields` and list the fields to re-admit:

```yaml
publish:
  exclude_fields: [secrets, gm_notes]
  overrides:
    fields:
      "Characters/NPCs/Vex Ambrose.md":
        include: [secrets]
```

The key is the **vault-relative path** of the note, extension included —
not its title, and not a glob. `include` is an allowlist checked against
`exclude_fields`: it re-admits a field that would otherwise be stripped,
and naming a field that isn't excluded does nothing. There is no
per-file `exclude`; to strip a field from one page only, remove it from
that page's frontmatter.

`fields` is the only key under `overrides` that the build reads. Whole
files are included or excluded through the publish manifest
(`_meta/publish-manifest.md`), not here — see
`content-filtering.md`. A build warns on any other
`publish.overrides.*` key rather than ignoring it silently.

## `vault.config.json` (in the site repo)

JSON file in the site directory. Controls paths, URLs, and
display settings that are specific to the generated site.

| Setting | Key | Description |
|---------|-----|-------------|
| Vault path | `vaultPath` | Path to the vault directory |
| Output directory | `outputDir` | Where generated HTML is written |
| Site title | `siteTitle` | Name shown in nav bar and browser tab |
| Landing tagline | `landingTagline` | One-sentence hook on the homepage |
| Host | `host` | Where the site is deployed: `github-pages` (default, or when absent) or `cloudflare-pages`. See `cloudflare-pages.md`. |
| Site URL | `siteUrl` | Canonical base URL. For `cloudflare-pages` this **must** be the Cloudflare URL (e.g. `https://<project>.pages.dev`) — Cloudflare serves at the root, so a leftover `github.io` URL breaks the 404 page. |
| Cloudflare project | `cloudflarePagesProject` | Optional. Cloudflare Pages project name for deploys. Defaults to the site directory's folder name. |
| Attachments directory | `attachmentsDir` | Subfolder in vault holding images |
| Folder map | `folderMap` | Maps vault folders to site output paths |
| Exclude directories | `excludeDirs` | Unioned with `publish.exclude_dirs` in `vault-config.md` (see § Precedence) |
| Exclude sections | `excludeSections` | Unioned with `publish.exclude_sections` in `vault-config.md` (see § Precedence) |
| Exclude fields | `excludeFields` | Unioned with `publish.exclude_fields` in `vault-config.md` (see § Precedence) |
| Exclude callouts | `excludeCallouts` | Fallback if `vault-config.md` doesn't set `publish.exclude_callouts`. `true` strips all callouts, or an array of types |
| Preserve directories | `preserveDirs` | Output subdirectories to keep across builds |

## Precedence

Three different rules apply, depending on the setting.

**List settings** — `exclude_sections`, `exclude_fields`, `exclude_dirs`
— are **unioned**, not overridden. If `publish.exclude_sections` (etc.)
in `vault-config.md` and the matching `excludeSections`/`excludeFields`/
`excludeDirs` in `vault.config.json` both supply a list, the two lists
are merged (case-insensitively deduplicated, first-seen casing kept), so
a section/field/directory named in only one file is still excluded —
neither file shadows the other. The built-in default list is used only
when **neither** file provides a list for that setting; as soon as
either does, the default stops applying on its own (it is not unioned
in alongside them).

**`vault-config.md`-only settings** — `mode`, `exclude_drafts`,
`theme`, `four_oh_four`, `overrides`, `section_titles`, and
`setting_year` — are never read from `vault.config.json` at all: the
`vault-config.md` value applies when set, otherwise the built-in
default (`setting_year` has none — unset just means unset). Putting
them in the JSON file does nothing.

`publish.system` is *almost* one of them: the build reads it from
`vault-config.md` only, but the `flush` command falls back to a
top-level `system` in `vault.config.json` when `publish.system` is
unset, to pick the GURPS vs CoC writeback. Set it in `vault-config.md`
and both agree; if a legacy site has it only in the JSON, leave it
there — deleting it would change what `flush` writes back.

**Scalar and passthrough settings** — `sheet_crest`, `exclude_callouts`,
`backend.statusBar`/`backend.inbox`, and the per-key settings inside
`images`, `banners`, and `locations` — follow simple precedence: the
`vault-config.md` `publish.*` value wins when set, `vault.config.json`
is used only as a fallback when `vault-config.md` doesn't set it, and
where the setting has a built-in default (`exclude_callouts` and the
`images` keys) that default applies only when neither file sets it.
`sheet_crest`, `banners`, `locations` and `backend.*` have no built-in
default at all — unset stays unset, deliberately, so the build can tell
"never configured" apart from "configured off".

## Content Filtering: DRAFT Entities

```yaml
publish:
  exclude_drafts: false
```

When `true`, entities with `canon_status: DRAFT` are
excluded entirely from the published site — they won't appear
in navigation, index pages, or as individual pages. Wiki-links
to excluded DRAFT entities will not resolve.

Default `false` — DRAFT entities publish normally with a visible
"Draft" badge, letting players see work-in-progress content
while knowing it's unconfirmed.
