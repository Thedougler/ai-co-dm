# Shared Patterns

Cross-system patterns and guidance that apply across all
supported TTRPG systems.

## Common Entity Attributes

All systems share these baseline entity attributes:

- Name (required)
- Description
- Tags
- GM notes (GM-only)
- Source document
- Canon status

## Validation Rules

1. Verify attributes match game system schema
2. Check skill values are in valid range
3. Validate derived statistics
4. Confirm required fields present

## Cross-System Considerations

When designing features:

- Don't hardcode system mechanics
- Use schema validation
- Support flexible attributes
- Allow system-specific extensions

## Generation Tone by System

| System | Tone | Key Flavour |
|--------|------|-------------|
| Call of Cthulhu 7e | Dread, fragility, creeping unease | Investigators are ordinary people; horror comes from helplessness and the unknowable |
| D&D 5e (2024) | Heroic, adventurous, high-fantasy optimism | PCs are exceptional from level 1; the world rewards boldness |
| Pathfinder 2e (Remaster) | Heroic high fantasy with tactical depth | Competence and teamwork win the day; the three-action economy rewards clever, coordinated play |
| Forged in the Dark | Noir grit, desperate ambition, messy consequences | Scoundrels claw for scraps of power; nothing comes clean |
| GURPS 4e | Neutral / setting-dependent | Tone is set entirely by the campaign frame; the system itself is transparent |

When generating content (NPCs, locations, plot hooks), match the
tone column above unless the GM's campaign explicitly overrides it.
