# Generic System -- Rules Reference

## Overview

Universal patterns for combat, social mechanics, exploration,
and other advanced subsystems. When the user's system doesn't
have a dedicated subfolder, use these patterns to help them
interpret and apply rules. You won't know the specifics -- but
the structures are remarkably consistent across systems.

## Initiative and Turn Order

Every system with structured conflict needs a way to determine
who acts when. The major patterns:

| Pattern | How It Works | Examples |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| Individual rolled | Each combatant rolls at the start of combat; order is fixed for the encounter | D&D, Pathfinder, Savage Worlds |
| Individual fixed | Turn order is derived from a stat, no roll needed | Some narrative games, Exalted |
| Group / side-based | Each side rolls once; all members of a side act together | B/X D&D, many OSR games |
| Narrative / popcorn | Current actor chooses who goes next, or the fiction dictates | PbtA, some Fate builds |
| Card-based | Draw cards to determine order | Savage Worlds (optional), Deadlands |
| Tick / countdown | Actions have a speed cost; lowest tick count acts next | Exalted, some tactical games |
| Round-robin | Players take turns in seating order; GM inserts enemies | Some indie RPGs |

**If you don't know the system:** Ask "How does your game
determine who acts first in combat?" and map to one of these.

## Combat Flow

Despite surface differences, most tactical combat follows the
same universal loop:

```text
1. Determine turn order (initiative)
2. Active combatant declares action
3. Resolve the action (roll dice, compare to target)
4. Apply consequences (damage, conditions, positioning)
5. Next combatant acts
6. Repeat until conflict ends (defeat, surrender, escape)
```

### Common Action Types

| Action | What It Does | Notes |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| Attack | Attempt to harm a target | Almost universal |
| Move | Change position | Some systems use a grid, others use zones or narrative range |
| Defend / Dodge | Improve your defense | Not all systems have this as a separate action |
| Use ability / power | Activate a special feature | Spells, maneuvers, stunts, moves |
| Interact | Use an object, open a door, draw a weapon | Often "free" or costs a minor action |
| Help / Aid | Give an ally a bonus | Advantage, bonus dice, or narrative permission |
| Delay / Ready | Change when you act | Common in d20 systems; rare in narrative ones |

## Damage and Consequences

Systems track harm in different ways. The major patterns:

| Pattern | How It Works | Examples |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| Hit Points (HP) | A pool of points; when it hits zero you're down or dead | D&D, Pathfinder, most d20 games |
| Wound levels | Discrete damage states (unhurt / hurt / injured / dying) | Savage Worlds, many narrative games |
| Stress and trauma | Separate tracks for physical and mental harm | FitD, many horror games |
| Conditions | Named states that impose penalties (stunned, bleeding, etc.) | D&D conditions, Fate consequences |
| Damage to attributes | Harm directly reduces a stat | CoC, Traveller |
| Composites | Combinations of the above | GURPS (HP + conditions), Pathfinder 2e (HP + conditions + dying) |

### Defeat and Death

- **Instant death:** HP reaches a threshold (usually zero or
  negative max). Rare in modern games.
- **Death spiral:** Taking damage makes you worse at everything,
  leading to cascading failure. Controversial but dramatic.
- **Incapacitation:** At zero HP you're down, not dead. Allies
  can stabilize you. Very common in modern heroic games.
- **Consequences without death:** Narrative games may impose
  lasting fiction changes instead of killing characters.

## Social Mechanics

Not every system has formal social rules, but common patterns
exist:

| Pattern | How It Works | Examples |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| Opposed rolls | Your persuasion vs their resistance | D&D, GURPS, many traditional RPGs |
| Disposition / attitude tracks | NPCs have a starting attitude that shifts with interaction | D&D 5e (hostile/indifferent/friendly), many CRPGs |
| Influence / social combat | Structured back-and-forth with "social HP" | Burning Wheel Duel of Wits, L5R |
| Single roll + fiction | One roll, interpreted through the narrative | PbtA, Fate |
| No mechanical support | Social interaction is purely roleplayed | Many OSR games |

**Universal principle:** Even in systems with social mechanics,
the fiction should drive the roll, not replace it. A brilliant
argument with a low roll should still matter more than "I roll
persuasion" with no context.

## Exploration and Travel

| Pattern | How It Works | Examples |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| Hex crawl | Map divided into hexes; each hex has content, encounters, and terrain effects | Classic D&D, many OSR games |
| Point crawl | Map is a network of locations connected by paths; travel between nodes | Many modern OSR games, some story games |
| Abstract travel | Distance is measured in time or narrative beats, not grid units | PbtA (Perilous Wilds), Fate |
| Dungeon turns | Time tracked in structured intervals (10-minute turns); resource depletion matters | Classic D&D, OSR |
| Montage | Travel is a series of player-narrated scenes, each with a check or complication | Some PbtA games, Ryuutama |

**Key question for exploration:** Does the system treat travel
as a resource-management challenge (rations, torches, random
encounters) or a narrative transition (skip to the interesting
part)? Design accordingly.

## Rest and Recovery

| Pattern | How It Works | Examples |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| Short / long rest | Brief rest restores some resources; extended rest restores most or all | D&D 5e, Pathfinder 2e |
| Scene-based recovery | Resources refresh between scenes or at dramatic beats | Fate, some PbtA games, 13th Age |
| Downtime activities | Recovery happens between sessions or during extended breaks | FitD, Traveller |
| Natural healing | Recovery is slow and measured in days or weeks | CoC, GURPS, many gritty systems |
| Magical / instant | Healing spells or abilities restore health immediately | D&D, Pathfinder, most heroic fantasy |

**Pacing implication:** How fast characters recover determines
how many encounters you can run between rests. Fast recovery =
more encounters per session. Slow recovery = each fight matters
more.

## When You Don't Know the Rules

If a user asks about a specific rule in an unsupported system:

1. **Don't invent rules.** Say: "I don't have a rules reference
   for [system], but I can help you work through it."
2. **Ask them to describe the rule** as they understand it.
3. **Help them interpret and apply it** using the universal
   patterns above as a framework.
4. **If they're confused about a rule**, suggest they check the
   book's index for the specific term, or look for an FAQ or
   errata from the publisher.
5. **For rulings at the table:** Default to whatever keeps play
   moving. Make a ruling, note it, and look up the real rule
   after the session.
