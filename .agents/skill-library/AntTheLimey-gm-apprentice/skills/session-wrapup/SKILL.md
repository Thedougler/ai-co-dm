name: session-wrapup
description: "Use when a TTRPG session has just ended and the GM needs to process what happened — generating recaps, updating entity files, recording timeline events, and identifying what carries forward to the next session. This is the post-session workhorse that turns raw play notes into organized canon. Not for session prep (session-prep) or during-play help (session-play)."
---

Post-session processor. Turns raw play notes into organized
canon, updates the world, sets the stage for session-prep
via the Wrap-Up file.

**Shared references:** Read `shared/session-principles.md` on
first invocation.

**Version check:** On first invocation, read
`gm_apprentice_version` from `_meta/vault-config.md` and
`current_version` from `shared/migrations.md` — frontmatter only, Read with `limit: 10`; the rest of the file is a long migration history you don't need for the check. If the vault
version is lower or absent, announce the mismatch and hand off
to campaign-organizer's migration workflow
(`campaign-organizer/references/migration-procedure.md`) before
proceeding with wrap-up. Resume after migration completes. Skip
this check if `_meta/` doesn't exist (that's first-time setup,
not migration).

**Document chain:** Read `shared/session-document-chain.md`.
Session-wrapup reads the Play Notes file and writes the Wrap-Up
file. It also creates/updates entity files and timeline entries.

**Wrap-Up file conventions:**
- Create the file from `shared/templates/session-wrap.md` — read
  it first; it is the canonical structure (vault copy:
  `_Templates/_Template_Session_WrapUp.md`, if present). Fill the
  full frontmatter: `session` (wiki-link) **and** `session_number`
  (scalar), `play_date`, `in_game_date` (session-end date, timeline
  format), `source_document` (Play Notes wiki-link), `reconciled:
  null`. Preserve the template's `<!-- gm-only -->` fence around
  `## GM Notes` — everything Keeper-facing lives under that single
  H2 at `###`, never as a sibling H2 (a sibling H2 publishes to
  player sites).
- Sections land in their **template positions** — the workflow
  visits them out of order (World Fact Findings at step 4c,
  carry-forward earlier), but the file's section order follows
  the template. The H1 and the `> [!info] Source` provenance
  callout (source file/export plus any structural caveat, e.g.
  "session ended mid-scene") come from the template too.
- Filename: `Chapter_CC_Session_NN_Wrap_Up.md` (zero-padded
  chapter and session numbers, underscores, no session title).
  Example: `Chapter_03_Session_07_Wrap_Up.md`. The chapter number
  is required, not optional — session numbers repeat across
  chapters, and Obsidian resolves wikilinks by basename, so a
  bare `Session_07_Wrap_Up.md` collides the instant a second
  chapter reaches session 7.
- Location: the session's own directory, e.g.,
  `Chapters/Chapter 3 - Vienna/Sessions/Session 07/Chapter_03_Session_07_Wrap_Up.md`
- Frontmatter type: `type: session_wrap`
- Session index `documents.wrap_up` link:
  `"[[Chapter_03_Session_07_Wrap_Up]]"`

**Session index fields:** The session index uses `play_date:`
(real-world date played) and `in_game_date:` (fictional date).
When updating the session index during wrap-up, use these field
names — not `planned_date` or `actual_date`.

**Trigger phrases:** "session's over", "wrap up", "post-session",
"process my notes", "what happened today"

## Workflow

### 1. Gather Sources

If this campaign has a published site with live tracking (a status bar or the
change-request inbox), pull players' final live vitals into the vault before
gathering anything else, so the recap and sheet updates below reflect where
the table actually ended. In the site directory, run `npx
gm-apprentice-publish flush` and report its per-PC summary — see publish-site
`references/live-state-flush.md`. If there is no published Tier-2 site, skip
this and proceed directly to Play Notes.

Read the session's Play Notes file (`type: session-play-notes`).
If no Play Notes file exists, ask the GM to provide play notes
(paste, file path, or dictation). Read PC roster. Read the
session's Plan file for planned-vs-actual comparison.

**gmassistant.app detection:** After reading the Play Notes,
check whether the content contains a `## Memorable Moments`
heading. If present, the notes are a gmassistant.app export
containing pre-written narrative (`## Summary`), structured
entity sections (`## NPCs`, `## Locations`, `## Items`), and
a scene-by-scene breakdown (`## Scenes`). Follow the
gmassistant-specific instructions in Steps 2 and 4 below.

### 2. Narrative Recap

**Standard path:** *Authoring operation — the input is shorthand
play notes, not finished prose, so generating the recap is the
job here.* Write 3-5 paragraphs of campaign prose. Dramatic,
character names, `[[wiki-links]]` for every entity. Tone-calibrate
per `references/recap-formats.md`. Stay faithful to the notes — no
embellishment, never invent beyond what they record. Optionally
also generate **Quick Bullets** (5-8 points, under `## GM Notes`)
when the GM wants a fast refresher — skip when the Play Notes
already carry a scene list. Write into the Wrap-Up file.
(authoring exception to `shared/content-fidelity.md`)

**Memorable Moments (both paths, optional):** a player-facing
`## Memorable Moments` section after the recap — one bold beat
line plus one italic context line per moment, block-quoted table
dialogue with `— [[Speaker]]` attribution. Include when the
session produced quotable beats; omit the heading otherwise.

**gmassistant.app path:** Adopt the content of the Play Notes'
`## Summary` section into the Wrap-Up file under the
`## Narrative Recap` heading. No rewriting, no condensing, no
tone adjustment (the exemplar preserve-guard; see
`shared/content-fidelity.md`) — but do add `[[wiki-links]]` to
every entity reference (matching the standard path's linking
requirement).
Skip Quick Bullets — the `## Scenes` section in the Play Notes
already serves that purpose.

This recap is the **single source of truth** regardless of
path. Session-prep reads it later — never regenerates.

### 3. PC Carry-Forward

Per active PC, note what carries forward. Focus on **player
intent** — stated plans, unfinished actions, shifted NPC
relationships, exclusive information. Ground in observable
behaviour, not generated emotional analysis. Write into the
Wrap-Up file as one `#### [[PC Name]] (Player)` block per PC
with the template's labelled bullets (**MAJOR —** for arc-level
beats, Intent, Knows, Relationships, Advancement, Resources) —
omit labels with nothing to say.

### 3b. Character Story Entries

For each active PC in the session, append a story entry to
their companion file. Read `shared/character-story-format.md`
for the full format, voice, and append protocol.

1. Look for `Characters/PCs/{Name}_Story.md` — if it doesn't
   exist, create from `shared/templates/character-story.md`
2. Determine the campaign's genre voice from the campaign
   overview or world file
3. Write 2–4 paragraphs of narrative prose: what this PC did,
   decided, learned, and how they changed — from this
   character's perspective, not a session recap
4. Append as `## Session {N} — {Session Title}` at the bottom
5. Update frontmatter: `lastUpdated` and `asOfSession` to
   current session; `canon_status` mirrors the Wrap-Up
   file's canon status

**Input:** Narrative Recap (Step 2) and PC Carry-Forward
(Step 3). No new source gathering.

*Authoring operation — a PC-perspective story entry doesn't exist
yet, so writing it is the job. Stay grounded in what the recap and
carry-forward record; no embellishment, never invent events or
feelings the session didn't produce.*
(authoring exception to `shared/content-fidelity.md`)

**Output:** One appended entry per active PC's story file.

Writes for the current session only — no backfilling. If prior
sessions are missing from a story file, that's vault-ingest
territory. Never edit prior session entries (append-only).

### 3c. PC Sheet Refresh

The Story file (3b) and PC Carry-Forward (3) advance every
session, but the PC's own entity sheet
(`Characters/PCs/{Name}.md`) does not unless refreshed here — so
its frontmatter and its **published** `## Current Status` freeze
sessions behind the narrative. The `## Current Status` block is
the PC's **cumulative living state** — the canonical, always-current
answer to "where is this character now, and what's still open for
them." Refresh the sheet of each PC **active in this session** (the
same set Step 3b writes a story entry for — this excludes `dead` PCs
and any who were off-screen this session):

1. Frontmatter: set `asOfSession` and `lastUpdated` to the
   current session (same values Step 3b writes to the Story file).
2. `tags`: replace the prior chapter/arc tag with the current
   chapter's tag (from the session index or campaign overview).
   Preserve all non-chapter tags (archetype, system, status).

   Do steps 1–2 for ALL active PCs in one call with the bundled
   stamper. It dry-runs by default — review its plan, then
   re-run the same command with `--write` appended:

   ```bash
   python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/shared/scripts/stamp_entities.py" \
     <vault> Characters/PCs/A.md Characters/PCs/B.md \
     --session "<asOfSession value>" --date YYYY-MM-DD --retag old-tag=new-tag
   ```

   `--session` is written verbatim, so match the vault's existing
   `asOfSession` shape — `"Chapter 4, Session 9"` where the vault
   uses labels, `9` where it uses bare numbers. The stamper refuses
   a file whose shape would change (it prints an `ERROR` line);
   re-run with the matching form rather than `--force-shape`.

   It touches only those frontmatter lines; body content and
   line endings are preserved. Steps 3–4 remain manual editing
   work.
3. `## Current Status`: **reconcile** the block — don't just
   overwrite it. Read the PC's *prior* block, then update it
   against this session's PC Carry-Forward (Step 3) and Recap:
   - **Carry** unresolved `Open threads` forward unchanged.
   - **Add** threads and exclusive knowledge introduced this session.
   - **Remove** `Open threads` the session resolved.
   - **Refresh** `Location` / `Condition` / `Carrying` to current truth.

   Use the labelled-field format (present tense, player-facing),
   **not** the retrospective narrative of the Story file. If the
   section is absent, create it; place it before `## Notes`/`## GM
   Notes`, outside any `<!-- gm-only -->` or `<!-- spoiler -->` fence.
   See `shared/pc-body-structure.md` for the field spec.
4. Leave `## Notes`, `## GM Notes`, and all gm-only/spoiler
   content untouched (protected sections — see
   `shared/pc-body-structure.md` for the
   protected-vs-excluded distinction).

**Input:** the prior `## Current Status` block + this session's PC
Carry-Forward (Step 3) and Narrative Recap (Step 2). No new source
gathering.

*Authoring operation — reconcile the living state to match the
session just played. Stay grounded in the carry-forward and recap;
no embellishment, never invent state the session didn't produce.*
(authoring exception to `shared/content-fidelity.md`)

Surface each PC's refreshed `## Current Status` and changed
frontmatter in the conversation for GM review (alongside the
Step 4 entity receipt). Do **not** write a receipt into the
Wrap-Up file — the PC sheet is the permanent record.

### 4. Update the World

**gmassistant.app path:** When the Play Notes are a
gmassistant.app export, use the structured `## NPCs`,
`## Locations`, and `## Items` sections as input for entity
creation and updates. Each entry already has a name and
description — use these as the basis for vault files instead
of extracting entities from raw notes. Entity extraction
markers (`NEW-NPC:`, `UPDATE:`, etc.) won't be present;
instead, compare each listed NPC/Location/Item against the
existing vault to determine new vs. update. If the
gmassistant description conflicts with existing vault
content, flag the entity as CONFLICT for GM review. Record every
export-vs-vault name correction applied anywhere in this
wrap-up in the Wrap-Up file's `### Name Conflicts (export vs.
vault canon)` table — Export said | Vault canon | Applied.
(Standard path: omit the section.) Use the
`## Scenes` section as the primary source for identifying
events that meet the decomposition threshold. All standard
rules below still apply: read templates before creating,
`canon_status: DRAFT` for new entities, receipt
lifecycle, wiki-links.

**Personal reference files:**
`systems/{system}/personal/` may contain the user's own
setting reference (factions, NPCs, districts). Check here
when creating entities to cross-reference faction ties,
locations, and NPC relationships.

- **New entities** (improvised NPCs, locations, items):
  Read `_Templates/_Template_{Type}.md` first, then create
  the vault file using that template as the structure.
  Don't ask — do it. `canon_status: DRAFT`. If
  session-play already saved provisional content, incorporate
  it verbatim rather than recreate — preserve the wording the
  notes already have; the template supplies structure, not
  replacement prose. Never pattern-match off existing entity
  files — the template is canonical.
  (rationale: `shared/content-fidelity.md`)

- **Updated entities**: Update the entity's own vault file.
  ONE file per entity. No separate "update" files.

- **Cross-entity claims from shorthand**: When a play note or table-assistant
  shorthand entry asserts something about *another existing entity* — an
  incidental aside inside a NEW-NPC line, e.g. a new innkeeper whose rates
  "{a distant established NPC} approves," placing that NPC somewhere they have
  never been — do **not** silently fold the aside into the other entity's file,
  where GM promotion would launder it into canon. The note's own review vouches
  for the entity it is *about*; a claim about a *different* entity has had no
  such check, and this is the only checkpoint it gets. Surface each cross-entity
  claim to the GM for a one-time confirm. If confirmed, write it into the other
  entity's file and log the resolution in the Wrap-Up's
  `### Cross-Entity Claims` section; if unconfirmed or deferred, record it in the Wrap-Up file's `### Cross-Entity Claims` section
  with an `<!-- UNVERIFIED: {claim} -->` marker — `reconcile` scans the Wrap-Up
  file (not entity files) for these and blocks promotion until a human clears
  it, so the marker only does its job there. Table shorthand is a hallucination
  surface — do not re-verify it forever, verify it once, here.

- **Relationship edges**: when an entity's `relationships:` block
  gains an edge, every `type:` must come from the controlled
  vocabulary in `_meta/relationship-types.md` (the genre-filtered
  subset of `shared/entity-schema.md`). Play notes give narrative
  verbs; map each to the nearest sanctioned predicate, normalize
  inverses to the base direction (`owned_by A→B` becomes `owns
  B→A` — store single-direction), and **drop** facts that aren't
  entity-to-entity edges (an `appears_in <session>` is a log
  reference, not an edge). One table drives both this and the QA
  repair: `shared/relationship-normalization.md`. Never invent a
  `type:` — an off-vocabulary predicate is invisible to every
  query and pushes to mobRPG as a junk Generic node.

- **New container entities**: when a new entity sits *between* an
  existing parent and its existing children — a district between a
  station and its venues, a cell between a faction and its members —
  creating it is only half the job. Re-point the children, or it lands
  as a childless leaf at the same level as the things it contains.
  Present the candidates for a yes/no each, then update the fields
  that match the containment's kind on each confirmed child: a place
  inside a place gets **both** `parent_location` and the `part_of`
  edge (scalar and edge feed different consumers; neither implies the
  other), but a person moved into a cell gets the `member_of` edge
  only — there is no membership scalar, and `parent_location` is a
  Location field. Table and procedure:
  `shared/relationship-normalization.md`.

- **Timeline**: Linked events:
  `- **{in_game_date}** — [[Event_Name]] — {summary}`.
  Inline events: `- **{in_game_date}** — {description}`.
  The `{summary}`/`{description}` line is authored from the event
  — keep it factual, no invention.
  (authoring exception to `shared/content-fidelity.md`)

- **Event decomposition**: Create Event entity files for
  moments meeting the threshold (≥2 of: changes entity state,
  multiple named participants, forward consequences, will be
  referenced from multiple entities). Use
  `campaign-organizer/references/event-template.md`. Event
  frontmatter uses `in_game_date:` (not `date:`).

  **Date format:** `play_date` is `YYYY-MM-DD`. For `in_game_date`,
  the published timeline anchors on a 4-digit year and accepts
  `"August 11, 1814"`, `"July 1814"`, or `"Autumn 1813"`; keep
  time-of-day out of the field (`"Evening, 11 August 1814"` and
  `"Midnight–dawn, August 7–8, 1814"` lose their date) — put it in the
  event body. A non-Earth calendar (Forgotten Realms, stardates,
  invented calendars) uses the world's own format — never fabricate a
  Gregorian date to satisfy the parser; it simply won't auto-sort if it
  lacks a 4-digit year. See `shared/session-document-chain.md`.

**Validation loop:** After writing entity files, run the
bundled `vault_check.py frontmatter --folder <dir>` on the
folders you touched (see `shared/vault-access.md`) and fix
every ERROR before presenting receipts. Deterministic, one
call — do not re-read files to self-check instead.

**Receipt lifecycle:** Show new/updated entity content to the
GM **in the conversation** as `## New Entity Files` and
`## Updated Entities`. This is the review artifact. Do **NOT**
write these appendices into the Wrap-Up file. Entity
files are the permanent record. The Wrap-Up file references
entities via wiki-links only.

Every entity reference: `[[wiki-link]]`.

### 4b. Update Campaign Overview

If `_Campaign/Campaign Overview.md` exists, update its mechanical
frontmatter fields. Read the file first, then present proposed
changes to the GM for confirmation.

**Auto-updated fields:**

| Field | Source | Logic |
|-------|--------|-------|
| `current_game_date` | In-game date at session end (from World State or GM) | Overwrite |
| `sessions_played` | Current value + 1 | Increment |
| `last_session` | Wiki-link to this session's index file | Overwrite |
| `last_play_date` | This session's `play_date` | Overwrite |
| `lastUpdated` | Current session reference | Overwrite |
| `asOfSession` | Current session reference | Overwrite |

**Confirmation prompt:**

"Campaign overview updates:
  current_game_date: "{old}" → "{new}"
  sessions_played: {old} → {new}
  last_session: [[{session title}]]
  last_play_date: {date}

Apply these updates?"

On yes: write the updated frontmatter. On no: skip — the GM
can update manually later.

**Do not update:** `current_arc`, `arcs_planned`,
`current_chapter`, `chapters_planned`, `status`, or any body
sections. These are narrative decisions the GM makes explicitly.

### 4c. World Fact Scan

If `_World/` exists OR session notes contain potential world
facts (heritage references, deity names, new place names):

1. Scan session notes using heuristics from
   `references/world-fact-detection.md`
2. Deduplicate each finding against `_World/_flags.md`
   (ignored → suppress, deferred → increment, canon →
   suppress), `_World/` domain files (already encoded →
   suppress), and existing entity files (already exists →
   suppress)
3. Stage findings in the Wrap-Up file's `## GM Notes` section,
   as a `### World Fact Findings` subsection

**Do not present three-state prompts.** Findings are staged
for the reconcile procedure (step 2.5) to present during
review. Session-wrapup detects; reconcile decides.

If `_World/` doesn't exist and no findings are detected, skip
this step entirely — no empty section.

### 5. What Carries Forward

Write under the Wrap-Up file's `## GM Notes` section, as
`### What Carries Forward`, using the template's subsections:
- `#### Unresolved Threads` — cliffhangers and live threads
- `#### Player-Stated Intentions`
- `#### Pending Consequences` — decisions made whose effects
  haven't landed yet
- `#### NPCs Needing Follow-Up`
- `#### Skipped Prep` — unplayed prep with critical clues
  players still need

### 6. World State

In-game date, location, active threats, faction postures,
ticking clocks. Brief. Write under `## GM Notes` as
`### World State`.

### 7. Keeper Checklist

Concrete tasks for next prep. Write under `## GM Notes` as
`### Keeper Checklist`: scenes to write, GM decisions needed,
rules to review, handouts to prepare.

### 8. Quality Notes

Brief, honest: what worked in prep, what was missing,
what to adjust. Write under `## GM Notes` as `### Quality Notes`.

### 8b. Handoff to session-prep

Write under `## GM Notes` as `### Handoff to session-prep`:
2–4 sentences stating exactly where, when, and in what state
the next session opens. This is the one section written *for*
the next skill in the chain — session-prep reads it first.

### 9. Review (Reconcile)

Invoke `shared/reconcile.md` to walk the GM through reviewing
the Wrap-Up. On approval, reconcile promotes session status to
`reviewed` and Wrap-Up canon status to AUTHORITATIVE.

If the GM defers review ("I'll look at it later"), leave status
at `wrap-up`. Session-prep will invoke reconcile as a fallback
when the GM next preps.

## Handoff Contract

The Wrap-Up file hands off to session-prep (via reconcile).
Wrap-up **must** produce all sections so prep reads one file:

| Section | Required | Written to |
|---------|----------|------------|
| Narrative Recap | Yes | Wrap-Up file |
| Memorable Moments | Optional (player-facing) | Wrap-Up file |
| GM Notes → Quick Bullets | Optional, standard path only | Wrap-Up file |
| GM Notes → PC Carry-Forward | Yes | Wrap-Up file |
| GM Notes → What Carries Forward | Yes | Wrap-Up file |
| GM Notes → World State | Yes | Wrap-Up file |
| GM Notes → Keeper Checklist | Yes | Wrap-Up file |
| GM Notes → Name Conflicts | Table-assistant exports only | Wrap-Up file |
| GM Notes → Cross-Entity Claims | If any surfaced | Wrap-Up file |
| GM Notes → World Fact Findings | If findings exist | Wrap-Up file |
| GM Notes → Quality Notes | Yes | Wrap-Up file |
| GM Notes → Handoff to session-prep | Yes | Wrap-Up file |

Sections marked optional/conditional are **omitted entirely**
when empty — no empty headings. `### Reconciliation Context` is
appended later by reconcile, never written by wrap-up.

Entity files and timeline are updated separately (Step 4).
Character story files are updated separately (Step 3b).
Active PC entity sheets are refreshed separately (Step 3c) —
frontmatter, chapter tags, and the published `## Current Status`.
The session index is updated to `wrap-up` status (or `reviewed`
if reconcile completes). Update `play_date` and `in_game_date`
on the session index if not already set.

## Sub-agent Opportunity (Claude Code only)

Step 4 parallelizes well — entity creation, updates, and
timeline are independent writes. If Agent tool available,
spawn sub-agents (light model) for concurrent entity work.
If unavailable (e.g., Desktop), run sequentially.

## Recap Style Guide

Match campaign tone. Read chapter overview and recent notes.
- Character names, not player names
- Past tense for events, present for ongoing
- Highlight player decisions and consequences
- End with forward momentum
- Horror: atmospheric tension even in recaps
- Social/romance: center interactions and relationship shifts

See `references/recap-formats.md` for templates.
