// Guarded lifecycle helper for ephemeral E2E test resources (Cloudflare KV
// namespaces, Pages projects). Built after issue #142: a session-driven
// cleanup sweep ran ad-hoc wrangler commands and deleted the *production*
// INBOX KV namespace.
//
// What this module actually guarantees:
//
//   - every resource this module creates is named `e2e-<runId>-<label>`;
//     there is no way to construct a bare production-shaped name (e.g.
//     "INBOX") through the factory.
//   - cleanup() only ever considers resources it tracked itself, and for
//     each one independently checks (a) the recorded name carries the
//     `e2e-` prefix, and (b) the record is the *same object* this instance
//     minted via createKvNamespace/createPagesProject — an internal Set
//     checks identity, not just field content. A record hand-pushed onto
//     `_records` with a spoofed `e2e-`-looking name and a real (e.g.
//     production) id is still refused, because it was never minted here.
//   - there is no list-and-delete or delete-by-title API: the only inputs
//     to a deletion are records this instance itself created.
//   - every tracked record is frozen at the moment it's created, so neither
//     `_records` (kept exposed for inspection) nor cleanup()'s return value
//     can be mutated afterwards to redirect a later delete at a different
//     id — a dry-run report can't be tampered with and then fed back in to
//     change what a real cleanup deletes.
//   - a record is removed from tracking *before* its delete call is issued,
//     so a duplicate entry in `_records`, or a cleanup() re-entered from
//     inside `runWrangler` (e.g. an adversarial test mock), can never see
//     the same record as still deletable and delete it twice. Whether the
//     delete fails (non-zero code) or the runner throws outright, the
//     record is put back at its original position — not the array's tail —
//     so it's retryable and a retry still processes survivors in true
//     reverse-creation order.
//
// None of this can protect against a `runWrangler` that lies about what it
// created — provenance here means "this instance's own create call returned
// this id," not "this id is actually safe." The guarantee is only as good
// as the injected runner; it's real wrangler in production and a mock that
// must never touch the network in tests.
//
// `_records` stays a live, writable array (rather than a defensive copy)
// specifically so callers — including this module's own tests — can
// exercise the identity guard above by pushing a foreign record onto it.
// It is the guard, not read-only-ness, that makes this safe: appending to
// the array cannot bypass the checks above, and the frozen record objects
// already in it cannot be edited in place.
//
// `runWrangler` is always injected — see tools/publish/lib/setup-backend.js
// for the same pattern. Real wrangler must never run from a test.
