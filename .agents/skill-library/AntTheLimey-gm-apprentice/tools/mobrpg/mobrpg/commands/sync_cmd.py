"""mobrpg sync — timestamp last-writer-wins reconciliation of description prose.

Replaces the hash/baseline machinery (pull-desc / suggest-desc, deleted in
Task 10) with a single verb driven by three timestamps: the note file's mtime,
the node's recorded `last_synced`, and the server element's `lastModified`
(Task 1 verdict — NOT `updatedDate`). `lww.decide` maps those to one of
skip / pull / push / tie / baseline inside a ±skew window; this command acts on
the verdict.

Directions:
  pull  — server is newer: overwrite the note's canon prose with the converted
          server description, preserving the vault-only tail verbatim, and stamp
          `last_synced`.
  push/ — the vault is newer (or a tie the GM must adjudicate): compare the
  tie     authored canon prose to the live description; if they normalize equal
          the note is already in sync (stamp only), otherwise file one reviewable
          `UpdateElement` suggestion and mark the node `review_state: pending`
          (the stamp lands later, on accept/dismiss — Task 9). Vault-only
          sections are never pushed.
  base-   never synced: there is no baseline, so timestamps decide nothing.
  line    Content decides instead — equal is in-sync, an empty local stub pulls,
          and an authored body just adopts a baseline stamp with the body left
          alone. A never-synced note never manufactures a push (#147).

A `review_state == "pending"` note is held (already awaiting adjudication) and is
not even fetched. Dry-run by default: it prints the per-note decision table and
writes nothing; `--execute` gates every file write and the suggestion submit.
