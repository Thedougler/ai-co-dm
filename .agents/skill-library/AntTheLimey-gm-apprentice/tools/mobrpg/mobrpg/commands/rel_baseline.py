"""Relationship baseline — discover mobRPG's PRE-EXISTING relationships among the
vault's already-linked elements and match them to authored vault relationships, so
`pull-canon --baseline` can stamp `event_id`s on edges that already exist upstream.

Why it's needed: the vault nodes were linked (element_ids) without a relationship
baseline, so every node relationship carries `event_id: null`. `suggest` skips a
relationship only when it's in `node_linked` (already carries an event_id), so with
no baseline it re-proposes every edge — 0 skipped — risking duplicate reified-Event
elements for relationships mobRPG already holds. This pass reads mobRPG's real edge
graph and fills those event_ids.

mobRPG models a relationship two ways (see the server's WorldElementRelationType
{Attribute, Link, Parent, Child, Spouse} and reified Event elements):
  - structural edge — a WorldElementRelation row (Parent/Child/Link/Spouse) with
    its own id, read via GET /world/{id}/{kind}/{eid}/relation (all types, both
    directions); the element-GET body omits these for non-events, so the per-
    element /relation endpoint is required.
  - reified Event — an Event element (eventType) whose participants are Link edges;
    read via the event list/detail endpoints (reused from `pull`).

Folded into the pull-canon verb (--baseline), not a separate verb.
