# campaign-organizer

## What It Does

Your campaign librarian. campaign-organizer takes your campaign content — scattered notes, session logs, character sheets, worldbuilding docs — and structures it into clean, interlinked markdown files with knowledge graph metadata.

It classifies entities (NPCs, locations, factions, items), creates structured notes with YAML frontmatter and wiki-links, builds relationship graphs, and organizes your narrative into a chapter/session/scene hierarchy. It works best with Obsidian but can also operate on a plain folder of markdown files.

## When to Use It

Reach for campaign-organizer when you need to:

- Set up a new campaign vault from scratch
- Import existing campaign notes into a structured vault
- Extract entities from a large document into individual linked notes
- Add relationship metadata and wiki-links to existing notes
- Organize sessions into chapters and scenes
- Set up graph visualization for your campaign
- Clean up vault structure after a period of messy note-taking

New campaigns usually start in **the-midwife**, which scaffolds the vault and hands off here for deeper organizing and importing.

## What You Need

**Obsidian:** Recommended but not required. With Obsidian and its plugins, you get the full experience — clickable wiki-links, graph visualization, semantic search, and template auto-application. Without Obsidian, the skill works directly on the filesystem, producing Obsidian-compatible files you can open in Obsidian later.

**For the full Obsidian experience:** open the vault in Obsidian and, optionally, install the Smart Connections and Templater community plugins from Settings > Community Plugins.

## Example Prompts

### New Campaign Setup

- "Set up a new Obsidian vault for my Call of Cthulhu campaign set in 1920s New York"
- "Initialize a campaign vault for a Blades in the Dark game in Doskvol"
- "I'm starting a new D&D 5e campaign — create the vault structure"

### Importing Existing Content

- "I have a Google Doc with all my campaign notes — organize it into the vault"
- "Here are my session notes from the last six sessions — extract the entities and file them"
- "I've got a big worldbuilding document — break it into individual entity notes"

### Enriching and Linking

- "Go through my NPC files and add any missing relationship links"
- "Link all the entity references in my session notes with wiki-links"
- "Check my vault for entities that should be connected but aren't"

### Vault Structure

- "Organize Chapter 3 into scenes based on my session notes"
- "I've added a bunch of notes without structure — clean up the vault"
- "Create stub notes for any entities mentioned in my session notes that don't have their own file yet"

### Graph and Relationships

- "Set up the relationship metadata so Juggl can visualize my faction network"
- "Show me which NPCs have no location assigned"
- "Run a graph hygiene check on my vault"

## What to Expect

When scaffolding a new vault, Claude creates the `_meta/` schema layer (entity types, relationship types, vault config, index), the folder structure for entity types, and template files. It will ask which game system you're using.

When processing existing content, Claude reads your documents, identifies entities, classifies them by type, and creates individual notes with frontmatter, wiki-links, and relationship blocks. It never deletes your original content.

For entities it can't fully populate, Claude creates stub notes marked with `canon_status: STUB` and a `## Needs` section listing what's missing.

Claude will ask before making changes to existing files. New entities start as DRAFT status.

## Tips

- Start with vault scaffolding before importing content. The schema layer needs to exist first.
- Feed it one document at a time for imports rather than everything at once. Better extraction results.
- After a big import, run campaign-qa to catch any issues.
- Don't worry about perfect organization upfront. You can always run the "weave" workflow later to enrich links.
- If you have entities that don't fit the standard types (NPCs, locations, factions, etc.), tell Claude. It can create custom entity types.

## Working Without Obsidian

campaign-organizer works directly on the vault folder —
Obsidian is never required. On first use, Claude will ask
you to confirm a folder path before writing anything.

### What Works

All four modes — Organize, Dissect, Weave, and Validate —
work without Obsidian. You get the same folder structure,
YAML frontmatter, wiki-links, and relationship metadata.

### What's Different

- **No graph visualization** — relationship data is written
  to frontmatter but you can't see the graph until you open
  the folder in Obsidian with Juggl. (Link discovery in Weave
  mode is unaffected either way — it uses the bundled search
  and graph utilities.)
- **No template auto-application** — templates are created as
  reference files, not auto-applied by Templater.
- **No Dataview** — query syntax appears as plain text.

### Upgrading to Obsidian

Open your campaign folder in Obsidian. That's it. All the
files, frontmatter, wiki-links, and folder structure are
already Obsidian-compatible, and Obsidian's built-in graph
view works immediately. Install the recommended plugins for
in-app semantic search and template automation (Juggl adds
the richer relationship-typed graph).
