# Benchmark Questions — session-play

**Skill:** session-play
**Purpose:** Establish baseline for split session-play skill (no prior coverage)
**Runs:** 3 per variant (Sonnet agent), blind evaluation (Opus)
**Campaign data:** `tests/benchmark-campaign/`
**Models:** claude-sonnet-4-6 (agents), claude-opus-4-6 (evaluator)

## Questions

### Q1 — Quick NPC lookup

We're playing right now. Quick — what does Elias Blackwood want?
Check his vault file at tests/benchmark-campaign/.

### Q2 — Rules assist

We're mid-session, Call of Cthulhu 7e. Can an investigator use
Spot Hidden while running from a Deep One? What's the penalty?

### Q3 — On-the-fly NPC generation

I need a harbour master for the Arkham docks. The investigators
are going to question him about suspicious cargo deliveries.
Make him interesting.

### Q4 — On-the-fly location generation

Give me 3 options for where the cult could be meeting in Arkham.
Each should feel different — I want choices to present to my
players.

### Q5 — Note capture

Notes from play: "PCs went to warehouse. Found crates with
strange symbols. Martha picked lock, Thomas kept watch. Heard
chanting from basement but didn't investigate. Left before
dawn. Martha pocketed a small idol."

### Evaluator prompt (blind scoring)

```text
You are evaluating two TTRPG GM assistant responses. One is
labelled A, one B. You do not know which is control or test.

These are at-the-table responses during live play. Speed and
brevity matter — penalise verbose answers.

Score each answer on 5 dimensions (1-3 each, 15 max per question):

| Dimension | 1 (Poor) | 2 (Partial) | 3 (Nailed it) |
|-----------|----------|-------------|----------------|
| Factual accuracy | Wrong stats, hallucinated names | Mostly correct, minor errors | All verifiable facts correct |
| System specificity | Could be any system, no mechanics | Right system but generic | Uses system-specific idiom, conventions, tone |
| Actionability | Needs significant rework | Usable with GM effort | Drop-in ready, use as-is |
| Mechanical grounding | No concrete numbers or values | Some mechanics but incomplete | Specific stats, DCs, costs, rolls, thresholds |
| Table-ready fiction | Generic/obvious/AI slop | Fits system but predictable | Evocative, system-native, sparks play |

Questions for context:

Q1: Quick NPC lookup — Elias Blackwood's motivation
Q2: Rules assist — Spot Hidden while fleeing, CoC 7e
Q3: On-the-fly NPC — harbour master for questioning
Q4: On-the-fly locations — 3 cult meeting options
Q5: Note capture — raw shorthand play notes

For each question, output:
- Scores for A and B on each dimension
- Brief justification (1 sentence per dimension)
- Total per question and overall total

Do NOT reveal which you think is control or test.
