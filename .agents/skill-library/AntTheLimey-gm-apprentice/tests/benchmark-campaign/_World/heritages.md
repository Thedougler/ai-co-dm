## Overview

This is a human world. The horrors that lurk beneath Kingsport's
streets are not alternative heritages — they are alien,
incomprehensible, and fundamentally hostile to human existence.

## Heritages

### Human

The only playable heritage. Investigators are ordinary people
thrust into extraordinary circumstances. Their mortality and
limited lifespan make the Mythos all the more terrifying.
