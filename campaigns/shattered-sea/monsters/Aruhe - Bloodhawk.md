> Nothing screams. Nothing circles low enough to see. Then: **THUMP-thump.** A pause. Wind over grass. **THUMP-thump.** Closer. The shadow reaches you before the bird does. When you find it against the cloud, four wings have folded tight against a charcoal body broad enough to carry off a whale.

  - name: Four-Winged Lift
    desc: "The bloodhawk can grapple Gargantuan creatures. When it moves a creature it has Grappled, that creature doesn't cause the bloodhawk's movement to cost extra movement. The bloodhawk's Fly Speed is halved while it is Grappling a Gargantuan creature."

  - name: Serrated Beak
    desc: "Melee Attack Roll: +13, reach 10 feet, one target. Hit: 28 (3d12 + 9) Piercing damage. If the target is Grappled by the bloodhawk, the attack deals an extra 7 (2d6) Slashing damage as the recurved teeth inside the beak saw through the held prey."
  - name: Hook Talons
    desc: "Melee Attack Roll: +13, reach 10 feet, one target. Hit: 23 (4d6 + 9) Slashing damage. If the target is a Gargantuan or smaller creature, it has the Grappled condition (escape DC 19). Until the grapple ends, the target has the Restrained condition, and the bloodhawk can't use Hook Talons against another target."
  - name: Terminal Stoop (Recharge 5–6)
    desc: "The bloodhawk flies up to its Fly Speed in a straight line toward one creature it can see at least 60 feet below it. This movement doesn't provoke Opportunity Attacks. At the end of this movement, the bloodhawk makes one Hook Talons attack against that creature with Advantage. On a hit, the attack deals an extra 27 (6d8) Bludgeoning damage from the impact. The target must then succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or have the Stunned condition until the start of the bloodhawk's next turn."

## Biology

Bloodhawks are four-winged Aruhe predators with hawk silhouettes and older, uglier hardware. Recurved teeth hide behind the pale beak, black talons close around prey like hooks, and the lower wing-pair carries weight during the climb. The second pair lets an adult roll hard in a dive despite its size. A full adult can lift a whale clear of the water; the same grip can take a lone body from open ground or open sky.

---
## Behavior

- **Habitat.** Bloodhawks own the open sky above [[Aruhe - Hungry Isle]], especially sea channels, lake bowls, reef gaps, river mouths, cliff faces, canopy breaks, and grassland rims.
- **Behavior.** At altitude, an adult rides lift in wide, quiet circles. When it commits, the two wing-pairs beat out of phase, and the paired **thump-thump** reaches the ground before the body does.
- **Diet.** Whales are preferred coastal prey. Inland adults take [[Aruhe - Bear-Elk|Bear-Elk]], [[Aruhe - Terror-Bird|terror-birds]], large reptiles, and anything flushed into the open. Canoes and small boats count as prey.
- **Social Structure.** Solitary adults hold enormous sky lanes. Juveniles sometimes shadow an adult hunt and drop on whatever the first strike drives out of cover.
---

## Tactics

- **Signs.** Use a moving wing-shadow with no call, crushed grass circles with no exit trail, bear-elk bones on terrace stone with no approach tracks, whale blood spreading in open water, crimson primary feathers, or the paired **thump-thump** during an active chase.
- **Instincts.** It keys on height, noise, exposed movement, open water, and prey already flushed from cover. It breaks off when the target disappears under closed canopy, deep grass, rigging, overhang, or protected water.
- **Tactics.** Start high and outside ordinary weapon range. Let the table hear the **thump-thump** before Terminal Stoop. The Bloodhawk stoops on the most exposed large target, seizes it with Hook Talons, then uses Haul Aloft to make altitude the danger. On the next turn, it tears into the held body with Serrated Beak or drops the body to regain distance.
- **Weaknesses.** Break the dive line with closed canopy, tall grass, a cliff overhang, ship rigging, or any hard sightline break. Force low altitude, ready attacks for the committed pass, or ground it; its land speed is poor, and Break Turn cannot answer a second hit after it spends its reaction. It will not put its feet into occupied [[Aruhe - River Otter|otter]] water.
- **Aftermath.** A Bloodhawk strike leaves torn feathers, falling blood, cracked branches, nest fiber dropped from high canopy, and sometimes a carcass placed where no ground trail reaches it.
