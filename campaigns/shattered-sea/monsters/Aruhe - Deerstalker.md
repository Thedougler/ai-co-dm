> The Deer-Stalker stands roughly eight feet tall on long, cloven-hoofed hind legs, its shaggy brown coat broken by pale patches across the shoulders and back. A long white deer face and broad branching antlers rise above its front-heavy body, while overlong forelimbs hang past its knees and end in black, fingered claws stained dark with blood. Pale eyes stay fixed over a wet black muzzle, where blood and spit thread from its teeth into the leaf rot.

## Visual reference

The supplied character reference sheet establishes the Deer-Stalker at roughly eight feet tall, with a shaggy brown-and-cream coat, broad branching antlers, a long pale muzzle, pale forward eyes, blood-stained forelimbs, black clawed hands, and cloven hind hooves. Its front-heavy upright silhouette keeps the overlong arms reaching below the knees, with dark fur gathered around the torso and shoulders.

## Behavior

- **Habitat.** Deer-Stalkers keep to the dim edges of [[Aruhe - Quiet Forest|the Quiet]] and [[Aruhe - The Marshes|the Marshes]], using game trails, wet paths, root shadows, and grassland margins where a sick deer shape can stand half-hidden. The grassland-river seam is [[Aruhe - Quiet Forest Cutoff Lip]]. North of that lip they work the forest-edge grass at [[Aruhe - Grasslands - Print Braid]]. They avoid [[Aruhe - Razer-Grass]] and [[Aruhe - Grubnade|Grubnades]].
- **Behavior.** A Deer-Stalker stands over a carcass like a sick deer. If disturbed, it crashes away too loudly, circles back through the dim, and repeats a voice it heard until one person follows.
- **Diet.** It eats fresh kills and interrupted carcasses, tearing soft meat first and leaving sweet rot around the site. Its hunger is animal and territorial, not a separate controlling force.
- **Social Structure.** Solitary. Two Deer-Stalkers ignore one another, and neither contests a [[Aruhe - Bear-Elk|Bear-Elk]] or [[Aruhe - Terror-Bird|terror-bird]].

## Tactics

- **Signs.** Deer tracks that become handlike claw marks, blood on low leaves, a dragged carcass, torn bark at shoulder height, long pauses in ordinary forest sound, sweet rot, and a familiar voice repeated wetly from the wrong place.
- **Instincts.** It wants the one person who answers a sound or touches its meal alone. It does not use the voice to control anyone; it uses the sound to make separation feel safe.
- **Tactics.** Open with Multiattack against the isolated target while Assassinate applies. Use Lunge and Drag to cross the gap and carry that target away, or Cunning Action to reposition without giving up the attack next turn. When two or more enemies close, use Break Contact and reset the hunt.
- **Weaknesses.** Keep allies within 10 feet, force it into bright or open ground, and refuse to follow a voice without the group. It will not walk through [[Aruhe - Razer-Grass|razer-grass]].
- **Aftermath.** A Deer-Stalker encounter leaves an interrupted kill site, blood threads on leaves and roots, clawed drag marks, hoofprints that stop making sense, and a lingering stink of sweet rot. There is usually nothing worth keeping.
