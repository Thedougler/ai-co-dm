# Anti-patterns

Seven named failure modes for DM-facing and owner-page copy. Each entry: what it looks like, why it fails at the table, a before example, and the fix direction with a vault exemplar pointer. The failure modes table in `SKILL.md` names these patterns and their self-check questions; this file provides the diagnostic detail.

## F1 — Role-description

**What it looks like:** The portrait names what the character does or is instead of what they look like. Job title, social role, inventory, and relationships stand in for a drawable face and body.

**Why it fails:** The DM cannot perform "a practical host" at the table. No face to voice, no body to gesture with, no habit to play.

**Before:** "Nona Black-Jaw is a practical Calveno host who keeps a guarded door and a sending stone close at hand. Bodyguards Enzo and Ruk are part of the household that surrounds her, linking kitchen warmth with Passage business."

**Fix direction:** Show the body first — face, hands, posture, one habit the DM can perform. The role emerges from what she does, not from a label. Role, faction, and relationships belong in At a Glance or Bank, not in the portrait.

**Exemplar:** [[Matteo Scola]] narration — "The man in the grey salt-stiff shirt keeps one hand near the split in his lip and the other near the missing boot. Wet hair sticks flat to his forehead. He watches the living people first, the water second, and the dark north trails only when someone else looks that way." Face, body, clothing, injury, behavior — all drawable in three sentences.

## F2 — Encyclopedia entry

**What it looks like:** Classifies the place by geographic type, regional position, or administrative function instead of placing the reader in it. Reads like a gazetteer article.

**Why it fails:** "The timber fortress-market on the harbour slope" tells the DM what kind of thing this is, not what the players see when they step off the gangplank. The DM cannot describe the approach, the smell, the ground underfoot.

**Before:** "Sparhold is the timber fortress-market on the harbour slope of Sparhold Isle, the closest Midchain harbour to the Teeth. Cut-over ground above the walls faces Teethward water."

**Fix direction:** What a body experiences on approach or arrival. Put the reader's feet on a surface. Use body-scale comparisons and affordance cues.

**Self-check:** Swap the proper noun for another settlement. If the sentence still works ("Harborton is the timber fortress-market on the harbour slope of Harborton Isle"), the description is generic. Rewrite for *this* place.

**Exemplars:** [[Aruhe - Quiet Forest]] — "Above the last terrace, the rainforest closes into trunks broader than doorways and leaves wide enough to roof a passage." Body-scale (broader than doorways), affordance (roof a passage), and a spine that is already this specific forest.

[[Aruhe - Clear Lake]] — "A shelf of black hexagonal stone steps into water so clear that schools of small fish show over round pale rocks." Underfoot stone, visible depth, a concrete detail that could only be this lake.

## F3 — Thin owner

**What it looks like:** The portrait covers fewer than three connected sentences, or misses one or more coverage dimensions: material, wear, scale-vs-body, or a non-sight sense for items; silhouette, body parts, and stable behavior for creatures.

**Why it fails:** A player asks "what does it look like?" and the DM has one generic sentence. No material to name, no weight to convey, no distinguishing mark.

**Before (item):** "Delmar Fisk's named rapier, The Baroness. A long slender blade sized for one hand. Drawn, it clears the scabbard in a clean precise line."

Missing: material (what metal? what hilt?), wear (new? battered? polished?), non-sight sense (weight? cold? balance?). "A long slender blade" could describe any rapier.

**Fix direction:** Cover the four dimensions. Type + scale vs body + material + wear + one non-sight sense or ordinary physical behavior, joined into about three connected sentences.

**Exemplar:** [[Fate Spinner]] — "A thumb-sized four-sided top sits small enough to pinch between two fingers. Quartz fills each face; the corners have dulled and the edges worn smooth from handling. It stays cool in the palm, and spun on a flat surface it turns on its point with a short even wobble before it settles." Concrete noun, scale vs body (thumb-sized, pinch between two fingers), material (quartz), wear (dulled corners, worn edges), non-sight sense (cool in the palm), ordinary physical behavior (wobble before it settles).

## F4 — Telegram stub

**What it looks like:** Isolated fragment sentences that list facts without connecting them to a body, place, or action. Reads like bullet points stripped of their bullets.

**Why it fails:** No flowing connection. The DM cannot read these aloud as natural speech. Each fact floats alone.

**Before:** "Kitchen heat. A guarded door. A sending stone within reach."

**Fix direction:** Join facts to the thing that owns them. "The kitchen runs hot, and she keeps the door guarded and a sending stone within reach of one hand" is the same facts as connected prose.

On DM-facing text, telegram stubs are equally bad: "DC 14 Athletics. Failure: fall. Success: climb." should be "**Climb** `DC 14 Athletics` → reach the ledge; failure → fall to the basin floor (2d6 bludgeoning)."

## F5 — Scenic filler

**What it looks like:** Atmosphere or mood sentences that change no choice, ruling, risk, resource, or improv handle. Default conditions stated as though they are notable.

**Why it fails:** Remove the sentence. If no decision, spoken line, or procedure changes, the line was dead weight.

**Before:** "The green is lush and the air is heavy with the scent of growing things. Birdsong fills the canopy."

**Fix direction:** Either cut it or replace it with a specific fact the DM can use. "Stonepears hang from the mossed roots along the trail — the party can forage here" gives the DM an affordance a player can act on. Weather, water, food, light, and safety are worth stating only when they are unsafe, costly, scarce, magical, claimed, time-bound, or a visible clue.

## F6 — Register drift

**What it looks like:** Wrong voice for the surface. Narrative recap voice on an owner page. Owner-page reference voice on a session beat's DM procedure. Session-beat procedure voice on a handout.

**Why it fails:** The reader — the DM — uses each surface differently. An owner page is a reference pulled mid-improv; a session beat is tonight's procedure script; a recap is last week's story. The wrong voice makes the right information hard to find at the moment the DM needs it.

**Guidance (no single before/after):**
- **Session beats:** Direct, imperative, present tense, scannable bold heads. "**If they try to cross the river**, `DC 12 Athletics` → reach the far bank; failure → swept downstream to the basin."
- **Owner pages:** Descriptive, present tense, complete enough to improv from. "Nona counts the cost of a favour before she names its reward. She keeps Enzo and Ruk between the room and danger."
- **Recaps:** Past tense, narrative arc, consequences that matter tonight. "The crew took the survey job and left three people behind at the basin. Matteo came with them, but he has not stopped watching the water."
- **Handouts:** In-world author's voice. A letter sounds like the character who wrote it, not like a DM note.

## F7 — Stale placeholder

**What it looks like:** "Visualizer: ingest pending," empty `[!narration]` bodies, legacy statblock fences, or "Use the original legacy Fantasy Statblock" left on a page the agent is touching.

**Why it fails:** "Preserving bad copy is a critical failure" — the skill's first rule. A placeholder is not copy. It is a gap the DM falls into mid-session.

**Fix direction:** If the file has enough information elsewhere on the page (Look/voice, Drive, public face, parent files) to write the portrait or fill the block, write it now. If not, route to the owning craft skill for stock and note what is missing. Do not preserve the placeholder and move on.
